<p>Are you ready to proceed, Mr. Wheeler?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Mr. Robert Krahl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Will you hold up your right hand and be sworn?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you are about to
give before this committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<h3 id="Robert_B_Krahl379">TESTIMONY OF ROBERT B. KRAHL, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS
COUNSEL, JAY G. SYKES</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Would you state your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. My name is Robert B. Krahl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Will you spell the last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. K-r-a-h-l.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. I see you are represented by counsel.</p>

<p>Will counsel identify himself for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sykes</span>. Jay G. Sykes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. When were you born, Mr. Krahl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. To the best of my knowledge, I was born on February
6, 1925.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Where do you presently reside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. I live in Seattle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. What is your present occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. I am unemployed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. What was your occupation before becoming unemployed?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. With the chairman’s permission, I would like to make
a very, very short statement, less than a hundred words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. What was the question, Mr. Wheeler?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span></p>

<p>(The pending question was read by the reporter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. That question calls for an answer, not a statement.
And you can reply or give the answer, and then make any explanation
you wish if it is relevant to the question and your answer.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. Well, I have been employed with odd jobs the past 9
months; haven’t really been employed. I just worked a few days here
and there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Would you relate to the committee your occupational
background for the past 5 years?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. To the best of my knowledge&mdash;let’s see; 5 years would
be around 1950. I think I have worked as a waiter, I have worked as
a draftsman, I have done a little extra work as a casual laborer,
worked a little time in a sawmill&mdash;I think that about covers it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. What is your educational background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. I graduated from high school. I have got a couple of
years of college. I haven’t graduated from college.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. What college did you attend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. The University of Arizona.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. When did you cease your studies there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. I think it was around the end of 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. How were you employed from 1947 to 1950?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. From 1947 until 1950 I worked as a seaman part of that
time; I think most of that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Have you served in the Armed Forces?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. In what branch of the service did you serve?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. In the United States Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. What were your dates of service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. I am not sure, but I think it was around the beginning
of 1951 until about the end of it, probably 2 weeks after the first of the
year, until a week prior to Christmas 1951, I am pretty sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. What type of discharge did you receive?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. I received a general discharge under honorable conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Are you familiar with the committee called the
Youth Committee that is within the circles of the Communist Party
in King County?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. At this point, Mr. Chairman, I would like to invoke the
fifth amendment on the ground that I think that this may lead into
questions which could force me to testify against myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Are you acquainted with Mrs. Barbara Hartle?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. I give the same answer, for the reasons previously
stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. You decline to answer for the same reason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. I decline to answer for the reasons previously stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. I would like to refer to part 2 of a document entitled
“Investigation of Communist Activities in the Pacific Northwest
Area.” It is a copy of the transcript of hearings held here last
June. Mrs. Hartle is testifying:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>About 1949 and 1950, the last year that I was in Seattle&mdash;a youth committee
was set up which I worked with, controlled, and guided all of its activities and
tried to train the youth along Communist Party lines; and on that youth committee
I remember a young man named Al Cumming, Robert Krahl, Calvin
Harris.</p></blockquote>

<p>Are you acquainted with Mr. Al Cumming?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. I invoke the fifth amendment for the reasons previously
stated. I believe that is the way to work it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. What were the functions of the youth committee of
the Communist Party?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. I again invoke the fifth amendment on the grounds
previously stated, and refuse to answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Was Mrs. Hartle correct when she identified you
as a member of the Communist Party, a member of the youth committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. I give the same answer, for the same reasons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Are you a member of the Communist Party today?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. I give the same answer, for the same reasons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. No further questions, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you decline to answer as to whether or not you
are a member of the Communist Party today, and, as the reason for
your refusal, do you invoke the fifth amendment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. That is correct; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Mr. Velde, any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Were you a member of the Communist Party during the
time you were in the Army?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. For the reasons previously stated, I must invoke the
fifth amendment and refuse to answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I take it that you will refuse to give this committee the
benefit of your knowledge concerning the Communist Party activities,
and rely on the fifth amendment whenever you are questioned about
anything touching on communism. Is that correct?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. I refuse to answer that question for the same reasons and
the reasons I have previously stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. How long were you in the service? I forgot the
period of time. That is, in the armed services of the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. About a year. Just under a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Was that the full period of your enlistment, the time
you served, or were you discharged prior to the termination of your
period of enlistment?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. Well, I was drafted. I didn’t enlist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Why were you discharged?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. I decline to answer, reluctantly, because I am a little&mdash;I
don’t really understand where this question of waiver comes in. So
I decline to answer that question on the grounds of the fifth amendment,
and for the reasons that I have previously stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Where were you stationed while in the service?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. Well, I was stationed for a while at Fort Ord. I think
it was a few days. And then I served the rest of my time at Camp
Roberts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Are you now or have you ever been a member of the
Communist Party? I believe the question was asked in another form.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. Mr. Chairman, I decline to answer that question on the
grounds of the fifth amendment, and for the reasons I have previously
stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did I understand you to say that you were given a
general discharge under honorable conditions from the Army?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. That is what I said; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. That is not as high class a discharge as an honorable
discharge; is it?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. Well, I really don’t know. I don’t know the answer
to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Don’t you have any idea why you weren’t given an honorable
discharge instead of a general discharge?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. At this point I invoke the fifth amendment and decline
to answer that question on the grounds that I have previously stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you know whether or not you were discharged
for security reasons?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly invoke the fifth amendment
again, and for the same reasons, the reasons that I have previously
stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. While you were serving in the armed services were
you at any time engaged in any un-American or subversive activities?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krahl</span>. Mr. Chairman, I decline to answer that question on the
grounds of the fifth amendment and for the reasons previously stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The witness is excused.</p>

<p>Call your next witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Mr. Robert Miller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Put up your right hand and be sworn.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you are about to
give before this committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you, God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I do, sir.</p>

<h3 id="Robert_Miller382">TESTIMONY OF ROBERT MILLER, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL,
SOLIE M. RINGOLD</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. State your name, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. My name is Robert Miller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. When were you born, Mr. Miller?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. To the best of my knowledge, November 22, 1922.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Where do you presently reside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Seattle, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. What has been your educational background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. General, normal grammar school. I don’t know
whether you call it junior or senior. And up to the third year of high
school.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Are you currently employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. How are you employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I am an appliance, radio and television repair man,
sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Is that here in Seattle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. And what has your employment background been,
say since 1940?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Since 1940, part of the time in the shipyards, part of
the time in Boeing Airplane Co. Part of the time also was spent in
the Armed Forces during the period which you mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. What is your military service record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I was inducted into the Navy, and, the best I can recall,
the dates are from June of 1945 until March of 1946.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. What type of discharge did you receive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It is difficult for me to answer that. I believe it was
an honorable discharge. There is some question now that you bring
it up, as to whether it was what the Navy refers to as a battleship
discharge, which I think they reserve to only those who have served
overseas. There are no peculiarities in regard to my discharge, if
that is the intent of the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. When were you employed at Boeing Aircraft?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. To the best of my knowledge, with interruptions, of
course, it was in 1943. I do not know now when I was last employed
by Boeing Aircraft except to place it in relation to an event which
would be several months prior to the strike which has been mentioned,
of course, in the proceedings. I could not recall even the month or the
year involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. How were your services terminated at Boeing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. My services were terminated for lack of attendance
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Lack of attendance at work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. While at Boeing were you a member of any union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. What union was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The Aeronautical Mechanics Union,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Are you still a member?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Why are you no longer a member of the union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Because when I was terminated from Boeing Aircraft
I saw no reasons for further continuing membership, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. I see you are represented by counsel.</p>

<p>Will you identify yourself, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ringold</span>. My name is Solie, S-o-l-i-e, M. Ringold, R-i-n-g-o-l-d.
I am an attorney practicing law in the city of Seattle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Do you know a person by the name of Barbara
Hartle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I have known her in the past, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Under what circumstances have you known her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I recall one. I have eaten dinner with her at my
father-in-law’s establishment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Did you ever see her on any other occasion?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I have seen her on television, perhaps on the street,
and I may have other than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Do you recall ever meeting her in connection with
Communist Party activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It is difficult to say as to what were the connections.
I would say that perhaps it was in relation to the Communist Party,
sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Have you been a member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. When did you first become a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. To the best of my knowledge, in 1943, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. What were the circumstances under which you
joined the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It is difficult to reach back that far for me and determine
just what motivated my becoming a member. The only
thing that I can recall is I attended several open Communist Party
meetings during that period of time and I saw nothing at variance
with what I believed to be for the common good of the people of the
country. I thereupon became active, and I could not even recall the
initial period of action, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Who contacted you to get you in the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. That I could not recall at this time, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. After you joined the Communist Party were you
assigned to any particular group or unit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Not at any time that I recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Not at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Not that I can recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. How long were you a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. There were perhaps interruptions while I was in the
service; I believe there were. To the best of my knowledge. I was
probably a member of the Communist Party from 1943 until 1948,
the best I can recall. I believe there was a period of time there that
I was not a member, and it is hard for me to distinguish between what is
actual membership and carrying of a card, if there is such a thing, or
payment of dues, and whether I just worked with them. It is difficult
to reach that far back in my mind, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. During this 1943-48 period I believe you stated you
were in the United States Navy. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. For a portion of that&mdash;from 1945 until 1946. Approximately
9 months, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. When did you say your employment terminated at
Boeing Aircraft?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I cannot name a date. I can only relate it to some
several months prior to the major strike which they had. I could not
name the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Was that in 1943 or 1944?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No. Could someone refresh me as to when the strike
occurred at Boeing Aircraft Co.?</p>

<p>It was 1946 or 1947; I believe in there, at the time which I was
terminated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Were you a member of the Communist Party while
employed at Boeing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes, sir.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Were you employed at Boeing when you became a
member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I do not recall. I think I was perhaps a member
prior to going to Boeing Aircraft Co. I do not recall, however.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Mrs. Hartle, in previous testimony before the committee,
went into quite a bit of detail on the efforts of the Communist
Party to infiltrate Boeing Aircraft. Do you have any knowledge
along those lines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The answer that you want from me is whether there
was any direction as far as I was concerned, as to where to get employment.
Is that, as I understand, the intent of the question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. At no time, to the best of my recollection, was I directed
to go anywhere to work or to do any specific thing, as I can
recall it now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Do you have knowledge of any attempt by the Communist
Party to infiltrate the Boeing plant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I have no specific knowledge which I can testify as to
facts, sir. I assume that is what you want, only things I know to be
fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Did you ever hold an office in the Aero Mechanics
Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes. I was at one time a shop steward, at one time a
shop committeeman, and, if memory serves me right, I was president
of one of the locals during the war. I am not too clear on whether
that was president or vice president, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. To your knowledge, were there any other members
of the Communist Party in the Aero Mechanics Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I do not know with any degree of certainty anyone at
Boeing while I was there who might have been members of the Communist
Party. There was certainly speculation or perhaps reason to
assume they were. However, I would like to confine my testimony
to facts, and I do not know any to be a fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. We desire to be confined to facts. Are you testifying
that you knew no one at Boeing Aircraft Co., to be a member of the
Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. To the best of my recollection at this time, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. You knew no one in the Aero Machinists Union
to be a member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. In the Aero Mechanics Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Aero Mechanics; I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I relate the two together, in that I believe the Aero
Mechanics were only involved with employees of Boeing.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. You have also stated, I believe, that you were not
assigned to any group or unit of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. To the best of my recollection, that was my testimony,
sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. You don’t recall who recruited you into the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I do not, sir. In fact, I might explain it this way: I
am not even sure whether it was any specific individual or whether,
during the course of an open meeting, it fell upon me, a desire to become
a member. It is difficult for a man to reach that far back in
years and testify with any certainty, sir.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. You were very vague in your testimony as to how
you became a member of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Sir, is it unreasonable to be vague on something that
occurred nigh onto 12 years ago when I was between the age of 20 and
21, sir? Is that difficult to understand, that a man might honestly
be vague?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. How many meetings of the Communist Party did
you attend from 1943 until the time you went in the Armed Forces in
1945?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I would be unable to give you any number with any
degree of accuracy. It would be pure speculation and only an estimate.
If you want an estimate, I could give it if the committee so
desires.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. I think you can speculate on this part of your testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. As I get the question, you are asking me how many do
I think might have gone to. If I am recalling something I would have
an actual number and would not have to estimate. I am not able to
recall any number of meetings at which I attended. There was perhaps
30, 40 meetings, I do not know, over this period of time. It is
purely a speculative answer, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. But you may have attended that many?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. That is right. And that may be at variance 50 percent
one way or the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. We are not binding you on this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Where were these meetings held that you attended?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I cannot recall specifically where any meetings might
have been held. In fact, most of my activity while at Boeing’s was in
legitimate, recognized trade-union work within the framework of the
contract with Boeing Aircraft Co. Most, or if any, activity with other
members, who I perhaps suspected to be Communists, or persons of
my particular persuasion, was not in the form of a meeting, but perhaps
I would meet one while at work, or I might meet one at the cafeteria,
or several of us might meet together in the cafeteria and just
discuss general problems.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Did you receive any direction from the Communist
Party to conceal your membership because of your employment at
Boeing’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I do not believe it was at anyone’s direction. Thinking
back&mdash;and I can only assign, a reason now going backward&mdash;I perhaps
knew of my own intelligence not to do so. I would perhaps be expelled
from the Aero Mechanics Union, which, of course, would mean
loss of employment at Boeing’s. I do not recall any specific direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. But you have testified that you may have attended
approximately 40 meetings during the period from 1943 to 1945, a
period of, say, 18 months or 20 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I had thought I was testifying during the whole period
at which I was in the party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. No, it is confined to the period from the time you
joined the Communist Party to when you entered the United States
Navy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well then, of course, it makes more obvious that the
answer was purely speculative and could well have been largely in
error. I thought I was answering or speculating in regard to my
whole membership in the Communist Party.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Would you like to estimate again that period of
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, I have got to go backward here. Which period
of time are you referring to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. From the time you joined the Communist Party
until you entered the United States Navy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. That would be from 1943 up until 1945. Right?
Two years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Again a purely speculative answer: perhaps 20 meetings,
sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Now you attended approximately 20 meetings from
1943 to 1945. And from 1946 to 1948 you attended approximately
20 more. And you don’t recall the place where any of these meetings
were held?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I have testified where I recalled that I thought we had
conducted some. I cannot recall any specific place. One or two
might have occurred at a rooming house where I stayed. I do not
recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Where were they usually held? Was there a regular
meeting place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. To the best of my knowledge; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Who called the meetings? That is, how did you
get a notice there was going to be a meeting held somewhere? How
did you know where to go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. About the only way that I can think of it backward
now, and I am not at all sure, is I would probably see or meet someone
else on the job or in the cafeteria, and they might mention that we
were going to get together and discuss the general problems.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. On the average, how many people would ordinarily
attend those meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. As I recall it, it was a very, very few. I could not
say. Probably under 10, looking way, way back. But it is difficult
to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Were they composed of people that you knew at
the same place of employment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. All of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. To the best of my knowledge now; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Proceed, Mr. Wheeler.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Mr. Chairman, might I make one brief point in regard
to this time? It might be better understood.</p>

<p>The question probably arises as to how I am so vague on meetings
and meeting places. It might be better understood if we take into
account that, as best I can recall, this occurred during the time when
the Communist Party was then the Communist Political Association.
I believe that they held open meetings. I do not recall too much
secrecy involved in it. And for that reason secrecy did not perhaps
impress itself on my mind. And to recall in one period of time
where a change takes place and into another, it changes things, looking
backward and forward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Yes; I can appreciate what you are saying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. At those meetings would there be a record kept of
the meeting; minutes of any sort?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Not to my knowledge, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Would there be an officer or a person presiding at
the meeting? Someone who would act as a chairman or some official?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Whether it would be a person who acted as a chairman
or whom the rest might just look to on the basis that&mdash;from the manner
in which they spoke, they appeared to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Were dues paid at those meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I cannot recall anything specific. However, I would
imagine that there were, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. I wish to compliment you for coming forward here
as a witness admitting that you were a member of the Communist
Party, which is far better and a better reflection upon you as an individual
and as an American citizen than to hide behind the fifth amendment.
But surely while you were a member you recall having paid
membership dues.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Sir, I would have to answer it in this way, that undoubtedly
I did. However, to recall a specific instance&mdash;I could not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you recall the name of any one person who
attended those meetings at any time? I mean during that long period
of time, with the frequent meetings you have admitted that you
attended, and the close contact that you had with the individuals,
where you say you not only attended meetings, but frequently had
lunch or ate meals together or visited with one another and discussed
the meetings, surely you could remember the name of at least one
person or more that you know, of your own personal knowledge, who
associated with you at the same time in that respect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Perhaps I am confused. Perhaps that is the difficulty
I have in answering. I was under the impression that the only names
which you wished from me, to give out here publicly, would be persons
whom I was certain or knew to be Communists.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. And it is only for that reason that I do not mention
names. It is probable that I could prod my memory into remembering
persons whom I met with or worked with while at Boeing’s in the
trade unions. But to identify them here gives the impression that
I am identifying them as Communists, which I do not know to be a
certainty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you recall the names of any persons who attended
any of those meetings that you have referred to as Communist Party
meetings or as Communist Political Association committee meetings,
who were not members of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Sir, I could not be certain of where they were. I mean
either way. If I was certain of those who were not members, that, by
process of elimination, would make me certain of those who were.
And I am not certain either way, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Mrs. Hartle testified that you were a member of the
Holly Park Branch of the Communist Party. Does that refresh your
memory to any degree?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. In relation to what question, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Do you recall being a member of that unit or cell of
the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I do not recall any activity in the branch that is
mentioned. It is possible that in their records or in their determination
that they maybe have regarded me as a member of that branch
and that I did reside there.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. You testified that during the period of time of your
membership, the Communist Party was dissolved and the Communist
Political Association formed. However, when you returned back
from the Army in 1946 the Communist Political Association had been
disbanded and the Communist Party reformed. A reorganization
had taken place and the party had tightened up considerably after the
Duclos letter, if you are familiar with that.</p>

<p>But did you notice, upon your return from the Armed Forces, any
difference in the structure of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don’t know that I paid any particular attention, sir.
I don’t recall any great activity in the Communist Party after I returned
from the service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. You have also testified that you left the Communist
Party in 1948. For what reasons did you leave the party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. As to the best of my knowledge, sir, I was dropped
from the Communist Party for inactivity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Have you attended any other Communist Party-type
meetings like the Socialist Workers Party since you left the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. To be specific, as far as the Socialist Workers Party,
I never have. And, to the best of my knowledge, I have attended no
meetings of that type, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. And at this time you cannot recall one individual
who was a member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, I could put it this way: I could recall knowing
Barbara Hartle. The only way I could say that she was is that she has
publicly testified that she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Mr. Chairman, I have no further questions at this
time. However, I would like to recommend that the witness’ subpena
be continued.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Do you have a question, Mr. Velde?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>I believe you said you got out of the Army in 1948. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. To the best of my knowledge, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. What prompted you to get out of the Communist Party
when you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. To the best of my knowledge, the party dropped me
for inactivity, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. You never wrote a letter disavowing membership in
the Communist Party then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No, sir, I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Or any other formal withdrawal from the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Not to my knowledge, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Are you a Communist Party member today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No, sir, I am not. And again I have to testify to the
best of my knowledge. I hope and trust that no one has me on the
rolls unbeknownst to me. To my knowledge, I am not a member,
no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I certainly do appreciate your coming forward. It is
rather refreshing.</p>

<p>It appears to me that with a little searching of your memory you
might be able to recall some of the incidents more clearly than you
have. I am sorry to say you are vague in your testimony about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
activities of the Communist Party in this area. So I will be in
favor of the recommendation of Mr. Wheeler that you be retained
under subpena so that you might check. If you want any assistance
from our files, I am sure Mr. Wheeler will be able to give that to you.
Next time you testify you may testify a little more definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. For your own benefit and for your own interest, I
will ask you this question:</p>

<p>You say, as far as you know, you are no longer a member of the
Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. That is with the fear that some organization or
someone might still be carrying your name on the rolls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It is a possibility.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you publicly, and here and now before this committee,
disavow any belief in the Communist Party and refute all of
the principles and policies for which it stands? Do you now take
that stand, and do you now so testify?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The question, as I understand it, is&mdash;I mean the question
of my avowal of a belief.</p>

<p>I hope I am allowed a little bit of latitude in answering this.</p>

<p>I state I am not a member of the Communist Party today due to
any action on my part. I further state that I disavow anything which
is contrary to the best interests of our country and of our people. As
to pinning it down to the Communist Party, I have to frankly
concede that I am not at all sure where the Communist Party is. I
mean if the things that are ascribed to them are true, certainly I disavow
them. I say that I have no association with them. It is only
that I hesitate to disavow anything that I am not sure of.</p>

<p>I am sure of the one thing, that I am opposed to anything that is
against the best interests of the people of our country.</p>

<p>Actually, since I was dropped in 1948 I have been inactive in all
political activities to the point where I am not even registered to vote,
I don’t believe, since 1948. I am confused on where most everybody
stands, and I have not enough facts to draw a conclusion on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The reason I ask you that question is because there
is considerable evidence before this committee and other investigative
Government agencies that many Communist Party members ceased
to be active as party members but have gone underground and still
continue in their same belief, the same philosophy, and with, of course,
the same objectives. I believe your answer is clear to this point:
you attended all of those Communist Party meetings; I believe you
said a hundred, and it would vary one way or another, 50 percent
either way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Approximately 40, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. That is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. But during that period of time you certainly must
have been well versed and qualified to know the purposes and the
policies of the Communist Party as such, because at those meetings
didn’t you study the Communist Party literature and study the purposes
for which it was organized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Is that the question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Has your opinion now changed with respect to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
Communist Party from what it was when you were attending the
Communist Party meetings? Or is it the same as it was then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I see what you are driving at, and it is hard for me
to get my understanding across.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. You say you have severed your association with
the party, and I want to know if it is just a technical disassociation
or is it a clean break from the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; it is not a technical disassociation. If I might
have a moment, I would like to go on a little further.</p>

<p>First, the reference is to having attended, say, up to 40 meetings,
one way or the other, and being aware of the goal of the Communist
Party. I would have to say this in all honesty: During the time I was
a member of the Communist Party I at no time was aware of their
desire to do anything which was contrary to the best interests of the
people. Now it could conceivably be that I was not aware, perhaps
naive.</p>

<p>All of my activity&mdash;and, in fact, that is what prompted me not to
take the fifth amendment. At no time in my life have I knowingly
done anything contrary to the best interests of the people of this country.
And certainly were I to be aware of that in an association and
continue activity I would be guilty of doing something against the
best interests of the people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The subpena that has been served upon you will be
in full force and effect. You will be subject to recall upon due notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Should I leave for the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>The subpena will remain in full force and effect, and you will be
subject to recall upon due notice at any time in the future. That
does not mean, of course, that you have to attend any of the hearings
here today or tomorrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would like to call Mr. Eugene V.
Dennett at this time.</p>

<h3 id="Eugene_Victor_Dennett391">TESTIMONY OF EUGENE VICTOR DENNETT, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS
COUNSEL, KENNETH A. MacDONALD&mdash;Resumed</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Dennett, at the time we suspended your
testimony you had completed your narrative with regard to your experience
in the CCC camp, and told us that immediately thereafter
you had been shanghaied into working shipping.</p>

<p>(At this point Representative Morgan M. Moulder left the hearing
room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. A little freight boat here in Puget Sound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am sure that would be a very interesting story,
but it is not a matter we are investigating in our work here.</p>

<p>After you had that experience how long was it before you returned
to the work of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. It was within a very few months because I didn’t
know at the time I started to work in the freight-boat industry in
Puget Sound that there was an organizing drive of a union to organize
the employees and that they had reached the point before I came
along where they had entered into an arbitration. And they were
awaiting the decision of this arbitrator. Finally the decision came
down, I think about 3 or 4 months after I entered the industry, and
the decision was so adverse that the men stopped work as soon as the
boats got into port.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What do you mean by saying that a decision came
down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The arbitrator handed down his decision. He was
a very long time making his decision. When it finally came down
it was very disagreeable to all the employees. In fact, they rejected
it; they refused to accept it and called a strike.</p>

<p>When they called that strike they were confronted with a problem
of electing delegates to attend a meeting of the union to determine
what course of action to pursue.</p>

<p>I was elected a delegate from the crew that I was working with.</p>

<p>When we arrived at this meeting&mdash;I believe the meeting was held
in the labor temple&mdash;we discussed the award, and the union leaders
at that time were very frankly disappointed in the results of it.</p>

<p>The sum total of it was that it led to a strike, and the members
seemed to like the way I presented their case during the course of the
arguments, getting ready for the strike. And when the strike occurred
I was elected chairman of the strike committee and chairman
of the negotiating committee.</p>

<p>So we were again brought into public attention, and the Communist
Party looked me up very quickly to find out what was going on and
to try to advise me how to conduct myself in the course of that strike.
They really knew very little about it. They learned a great deal from
me because I was working with the men. And their advice was I
must immediately fight the leadership of the union.</p>

<p>I made a few feeble efforts in that direction and found that I
didn’t have any good reason for fighting that leadership because they
were carrying out the program which I had advocated in the original
strike meeting to satisfy the needs of the members.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Apparently, the Communist Party was more interested
in promoting its own objectives than it was the objectives of
the union which was on strike.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. They were anxious that someone from the Communist
Party gain control in that organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the name of the organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. At that time it was called the Ferry Boatmen’s
Union of the Pacific. It later has changed its name, and, in making
use of that name, I certainly want it to be clearly understood that
using that name in nowise should be construed as meaning that it was
any Communist organization because it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It rather demonstrated just the contrary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. And its leaders were not.</p>

<p>But the leaders of that organization were making as sincere an effort
as they knew how to represent the wishes and needs of the membership.</p>

<p>While there were some tactical differences between myself and them
on various occasions, we did adopt a program wherein we agreed
with each other that none of us would attempt to do anything or to
speak in behalf of the organization without conferring with the other.
In other words, we made a mutual agreement among ourselves as
officials of the strike committee which required the exchange of mutual
confidence. And, to the best of my ability, I carried that out, and
I think, in all fairness, it should be said that, to the best of their
ability, they carried their part out. I think the value of that is
demonstrated by the fact that in the final settlement of that strike we
succeeded in raising the wages of the freight-boat employees from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
$49 per month, without any regulation of hours, to a wage of about
$150 per month with a regulation of hours and provision for overtime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span> (presiding).</p>

<p>I am not quite clear about this ferry boatmen’s union. Was it a local
union not affiliated with any other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. It was a part of an American Federation affiliate.
At that time it was the Ferry Boatmen’s Union of the Pacific, affiliated
with the International Seamen’s Union of America, affiliated with
the American Federation of Labor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. In what year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That was in 1936.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. How large was the local? How many members?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I think there were in the neighborhood of 300 or
400 members in Puget Sound at that time. But that, of course, controlled
all the tug boats and all the barges, all the towing, all the
servicing, on the waterside of the smaller vessels.</p>

<p>I think that that completes the statement of what was in progress at
the time of the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. After this experience on the waterfront what was
your next contact with the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The next occurred in the district council of the
Maritime Federation of the Pacific. That was Northwest District
Council No. 1 which was in Seattle. This was the council to which
delegates were sent from all the maritime unions.</p>

<p>(At this point Representative Morgan M. Moulder returned to
the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. And some of the shoreside unions, which worked in
the shipyards.</p>

<p>These unions were brought together in the 1934 strike, which was
before my time. And I would be presuming on you to try to give any
testimony about the exact way in which it was formed except to say
that, consistent with the Communist Party policy, it was our objective,
from the days of the old Marine Workers Industrial Union, which was
one of the affiliates of the Red International of Labor Unions, to
organize all the maritime workers into one organization.</p>

<p>However, it was the desire of the workers in the industry to choose
their membership in the duly constituted, chartered organizations of
craft unions which were already in the field, such as the Sailors’ Union
of the Pacific, the Marine Firemen, Oilers, Water Tenders and Wipers
Association, the Marine Cooks and Stewards of the Pacific.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> And
later on I believe the radio operators, the masters, mates, and pilots,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
and the marine engineers.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Then, of course, the shoreside organizations
of longshoremen, machinists and shipwrights, joiners, boilermakers.
There were many organizations that were involved in any
kind of waterborne traffic.</p>

<p>Through the Maritime Federation of the Pacific all of these were
brought together, and, for a brief period of time at least, cooperated
quite successfully.</p>

<p>However, by 1935 one organization began to object to the Communist
Party influence in the federation. That was the sailors’ union
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
under Harry Lundeberg. However, in that dispute it wasn’t clear to
the average person who was in the industry just what the nature of the
dispute was, and most people felt that the dispute was a personal
dispute between the leaders of the sailors and the leaders of the longshoremen.
My own knowledge of the situation, of a later date, would
lead me to believe that that is not an adequate explanation of what
the dispute was all about.</p>

<p>The dispute ran much deeper than personality clashes. The dispute
was a fundamental policy question dispute, and that dispute centered
around whether or not the organization would move closer and
closer to the Red International of Labor Unions through this new
form or whether it would permit itself to separate into the respective
component parts and each function separately and independently
without that international Red affiliation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the outcome of that dispute?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The outcome was that the split spread. First one
organization and then another began to have misgivings as to the
consequences of being full partners in the Maritime Federation of the
Pacific.</p>

<p>The first one to show the disaffection were the sailors. Subsequently
the marine firemen showed disaffection. Then the master
mates and pilots showed disaffection. And the marine engineers
showed disaffection. The radio operators began to show some disaffection.
Some of the longshoremen showed disaffection.</p>

<p>So the result was that by the time 1937 or 1938 rolled around the
Maritime Federation was becoming sort of a bare skeleton which
existed with a powerful name but did not have the moral backing and
support of the members of the organizations that were affiliated to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was the organization Communist-dominated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The Maritime Federation of the Pacific top leadership
had at all times some prominent Communist leaders, some persons
who were Communists.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Can you at this time give us the names of those who
occupied an official position in that organization who were known to
you to be members of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. One of the first ones that I knew was a man by the
name of Walter Stack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did Walter Stack become very prominent in the
Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Walter Stack was in the marine firemen’s union and
exercised a great deal of influence in that organization here.</p>

<p>Another was Ernest Fox. Ernest Fox was a patrolman in the
Sailors Union of the Pacific, and he exercised a great deal of influence
in the sailors union. He was one of the original ones. When Mr.
Lundeberg was the first president of the organization Mr. Fox was
his right hand bower who did most of the leg work for Mr. Lundeberg
at that time. Lundeberg was the first president of the Maritime Federation
of the Pacific.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. At that time was he anti-Communist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I think, from the stories that I have been told, that
Mr. Lundeberg was thought so well of at that time that he was invited
to take part and did participate in some top fraction meetings of the
Communist Party in the Maritime Federation. And when he turned
against the Communist Party a little bit later on that incensed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
Communists so much that they looked upon Mr. Lundeberg as a potential
traitor who might reveal a good deal more about them than they
wished to have revealed, so that they launched many attacks upon Mr.
Lundeberg for the political purpose of diverting the attention from
the real reason for the attack.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say by that that I endorsed everything Mr. Lundeberg
did, because I disagreed with most of the things he did on a
straight trade-union basis on a later date. But this much about that
relationship I do know, and I know that&mdash;continuing the answer to
your question as to the others&mdash;the next one whom I knew who also
became president of the Maritime Federation of the Pacific was a man
by the name of James Engstrom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you spell the name, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. E-n-g-s-t-r-o-m. Engstrom also came from the
Marine Firemen’s Union here in the Seattle branch. Mr. Engstrom
exercised powerful influence in the organization. However, he came
to a very sad end in his relationships there because, for some reason
or other, he began to have some difficulty following the Communist
Party line and instructions, and ultimately took a vacation, went to
Alaska, thought the situation over, and I believe that he informed some
Federal Government agency of his connection and relationship at
that time, and severed his connection or resigned from his position,
and what happened to him after that I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I am not clear on this probably because I am not up on
my organization of labor unions as well as I should be.</p>

<p>Was the Sailors Union of the Pacific a part of the unit within the
federation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes, it was affiliated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. It was not a new organization then when it split off
under&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. No. The Sailors Union of the Pacific is one of the
oldest organizations on the west coast, founded originally by old
Andrew Furuseth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Is the same true of the other organizations that split
from the federation? Were they at one time units within the federation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes, they were. Later on there was a man that became
an official in the Maritime Federation, by the name of Pringle,
P-r-i-n-g-l-e. I do not remember his first name. Pringle occupied
a high position in the federation. I do not recall at this moment the
exact position, but I do know that when I had business to transact on
behalf of the Ferry Boatsmen’s Union at that time, as it was known,
I had to deal with Mr. Pringle. And he was a member of the party
also.</p>

<p>Later on I came to know another person who later became president
of the Maritime Federation, and was the last president to the best of
my recollection, a man by the name of Bruce Hannon, H-a-n-n-o-n.
Mr. Bruce Hannon was a longshoreman from the city of Seattle,
worked on the Seattle waterfront for a good many years. Mr. Hannon
also came into conflict with the Communist Party policy while
he was a member of the Communist Party, and totally disagreed with
the decision to wipe out the Maritime Federation.</p>

<p>The policy decision arrived at on that question was due to the fact
that the CIO was coming into existence in 1937, and it was the belief
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
of the Communist Party that if the Maritime Federation were dissolved
and liquidated that the affiliates of it would form a very good,
solid, and substantial core of the new CIO organization and would be
able to take all the fishermen unions with it into the CIO.</p>

<p>Mr. Hannon did not agree with that policy. He felt that the Maritime
Federation still had a function to perform and it should not have
been liquidated. And he came into violent dispute with the party
leadership over that question. How it was finally resolved I do not
know. I did not see Mr. Hannon until after the war, and I met him
one day very casually and he did not at that time express anything
definitive which I could contribute now to enlighten anyone as to what
he felt except to say that he was still bitter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. As a result of that change of emphasis on the part
of the Communist Party, that is, from the Maritime Federation to its
component parts, which were to form another organization, was the
Maritime Federation of the Pacific disbanded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Can you give us the approximate date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. To the best of my recollection, it would be right
around 1938 or 1939. I may be a little bit off one year or another
there, but it is close to that date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. During this period, between the time that you were
shanghaied on a boat here in Seattle and 1938, did you engage in any
other activities in the Communist Party not connected with maritime
affairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I certainly did. I was sent as a delegate from the
Inlandboatmen’s Union.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> The name didn’t become Inlandboatmen
until much later, but I think of it now in that term. The name
actually was Ferry Boatmen’s Union at that time.</p>

<p>As a result of the successful conduct of our strike in 1936, the
members and the good relationship which was established between
the officers and myself, the officers agreed with the membership in
electing me a delegate to represent the organization in the Central
Labor Council. And that, of course, involved attending a weekly
meeting every Wednesday night in the labor temple.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. In Seattle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Just tell us very briefly what the Central Labor
Council was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. It was the city organization to which all American
Federation of Labor affiliates were affiliated, and sent delegates to discuss
their mutual business weekly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did the fact that you were sent there as a delegate
make you a member of the Central Labor Council?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. It did. Because of my activity in the Maritime Federation
District Council, the delegates there, most of whom were also
delegates to the Central Labor Council, elected me chairman of
the maritime caucus which was comprised of all those affiliates from
the maritime unions who were also affiliates of the Central Labor
Council. There was a duplication of affiliation there, and I was
elected chairman of that caucus. As that chairman, I was able to
speak in behalf of that caucus&mdash;all those maritime delegates&mdash;which
was the largest caucus at that time in the Central Labor Council.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span></p>

<p>Consequently, when I arose to speak the chairman of the Central
Labor Council would recognize me rather than recognize any other
member of the caucus because he was recognizing the duly elected
leadership of the caucus. Consequently, it was my function to represent
that caucus on the floor of the Central Labor Council on all important
questions, which I did. And it caused a great deal of attention
to be focused on my work and on the work of the maritime unions.</p>

<p>We were trying our level best to support the policies which the
Communist Party urged upon us, and that pertained especially to the
question of war, fighting the program of involvement in war at that
time. It involved being very critical of the top leadership of the
American Federation of Labor, which many other people criticized as
well as we, and by we, I mean the Communists were not the only ones
that criticized; many of the rank-and-file members who had no
knowledge of Communist Party policy or activity were also critical.
But because of this similarity of criticism, the Communists, knowing
where they were going, were able to direct this criticism along very
effective lines. And I was a central instrument in that effort in the
Central Labor Council in the city of Seattle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. As a result of your experience on the Central Labor
Council were you selected for other organizational work in the
Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes, I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the nature of your work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The Communist Party recognized that the position
which I was attaining in the Central Labor Council represented a
powerful political influence in the city because the city of Seattle at
that time had the reputation of being the best organized labor city
in the United States of America. There was hardly an industry that
was not actually organized in some labor union, holding bona fide
labor-union contracts with its management or employer. And the
city had a very wide reputation in that respect. Some people looked
upon that as good; some people looked upon it as bad. The Communist
Party looked upon it as being very good because it provided
us an opportunity to reach every single worker in the city indirectly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Would you say that as a result of your successful
efforts while a member of the Central Labor Council, you took part
in other Communist Party activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you describe the nature of those activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. It was in the Washington Commonwealth Federation,
which was an organization which came into existence, the elements
of it came into existence, prior to my coming from the CCC’s.
But this organization originally grew out of the transformation from
the unemployed to the employed workers. And people built what
was known as Commonwealth Builder Clubs. And then, of course,
you recall that in that earlier period, 1933, there was a change of
political administration due to a national election. And in that
period there were a group of young, ambitious politicians who wanted
to get elected to public office. There were many young aspiring graduates
of college who felt that they had a contribution to make, and
they sought audiences before these respective organizations to win
political favor, make speeches and otherwise become publicly known
so that when they did choose to file as a candidate for public office
that they could expect enough support to get elected.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span></p>

<p>These Commonwealth Builders ultimately merged and formed
what was known as the Washington Commonwealth Federation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was there anything of a Communist origin that you
know of in the establishment of the Commonwealth Builders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. No. To the best of my knowledge, this was a result
of the efforts of people who were not directed or led by the Communist
Party. However, their efforts met with such sweeping success that
the Communist Party had to concern itself if it was going to remain
a political factor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In other words, the Communist Party in order to
become the leader in the field which it desired, would have to get control
of such organizations. Is that what you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Absolutely. We recognized that. And since being
pushed into leadership in various activities in the city, it fell to me
to do a lot of this representative work of the Communist Party in the
ranks of the Washington Commonwealth Federation, because the
prestige I had in the Inland Boatmen’s Union as a result of the successful
strike made it a comparatively simple matter for the members
to elect me a delegate and be a bona fide representative of a bona
fide labor union in the Washington Commonwealth Federation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Without going into detail, will you tell us what the
connection was, between the Commonwealth Builders and the Washington
Commonwealth Federation, or how one may have succeeded
the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The Commonwealth Builders were the groups of
small organizations which preceded the Washington Commonwealth
Federation. The Communist Party became interested in the success
of Commonwealth Builders and brought forth some proposals to cause
the organization to expand and grow.</p>

<p>One of the proposals of the Communist Party was that steps should
be taken by the Commonwealth Builders to make possible the affiliation
not only of neighborhood groups alone&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Neighborhood groups of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Of either Democrats or Commonwealth Builders,
or unemployed organizations or Workers Alliance. There are still
a few remnants of those, remnants of the old Unemployed Citizens
League organizations. These had all transformed and became the
foundation upon which the Commonwealth Builders rested.</p>

<p>The Communist Party, however, conceived that if the organization
were to become as powerful as it should and ought to be, that provision
should be made for the affiliation of larger organizations. And the
Communist Party succeeded in prevailing upon most of its members
to enter the American Federation of Labor unions. Consequently
it was a simple matter to introduce resolutions in numerous labor
unions urging that the American Federation of Labor unions affiliate
with the Washington Commonwealth Federation. At the same time
they proposed the calling of a convention to broaden the base of the
organization of this Commonwealth Builders.</p>

<p>That was done. And the Washington Commonwealth Federation
was brought into existence as an organization with affiliation from
large numbers of unions in addition to Democratic clubs and unemployed
clubs and fraternal organizations. Anything and everything
which was willing to affiliate was certainly welcomed and urged to
affiliate to the organization, pay dues, participate in its conventions,
participate in the electoral activities it engaged in.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The method that the Communist Party used to
assist in the organization of the Washington Commonwealth Federation
was to induce the leadership of the particular organizations which
they were members of, such as the various labor organizations that you
mentioned&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. They would raise perfectly legitimate reasons which
any ordinary person would recognize as proper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And they brought their influence to bear on the
formation of the organization through that method.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. As a result of that action did you say a convention
was held?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. A convention of the Commonwealth Builders was
held, which changed the name to Washington Commonwealth Federation.</p>

<p>(At this point Representative Harold H. Velde left the hearing
room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Because of that affiliation of whole organizations
which were not geographical in nature&mdash;take a labor union: It was
not geographical in nature; it was a complete affiliate without having
geographical definition whereas a Democratic club in a particular
district or a particular part of the city was restricted to a particular
area.</p>

<p>I say the federation part became a necessary part of the title because
of the nature of the changed affiliations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Before the name was changed what was the title?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Commonwealth Builders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In other words, it was a conversion of Commonwealth
Builders into an overall organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. It was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Titled “Washington Commonwealth Federation.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The committee will stand in recess for approximately
5 minutes.</p>

<p>(Whereupon a short recess was taken.)</p>

<p>(Representatives Moulder and Velde were present upon reconvening
at the expiration of the recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Dennett, I think you have made it clear in your
testimony that the Commonwealth Builders were not organized by
the Communist Party and that there was very little, if any, Communist
Party influence within those affiliated organizations as such. Am
I correct in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Well, that is essentially correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I want to be certain as to what the picture is with
regard to the Washington Commonwealth Federation which succeeded;
that is, whether or not at the inception of that organization
it was heavily controlled by the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. No; it was not. And, as a matter of fact, it was
quite anti-Communist at the very beginning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The original method used by the Communist Party
to become entrenched in the federation was through the various organizations
which were affiliated with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Through the process of building the organization
larger and bringing into affiliation organizations in which it did have
influence and ultimately getting top influence in the WCF.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I think that explains it.</p>

<p>You made reference to a convention that was being called. When
and where was the convention held? That is, the convention of the
Washington Commonwealth Federation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. In the year 1936 it held two conventions. One was
in April and another one was later in the year. The one in April was
concerned with several important questions. It was the largest convention
of any of the WCF conventions that I ever attended, and I
understood it was the largest convention ever held. It was in Everett,
Wash., in April 1936.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that 1936 was a Presidential campaign.
The political situation in the whole country was quite alive. Many
new people were rising in the political sphere. And, of course, the
Washington Commonwealth Federation was an open and ready instrument
through which ambitious political persons could make their
first bid for public office and fame.</p>

<p>Many of them did so. Many young graduates of the university
did so. I have very little personal knowledge about them, and I wish
to make sure that you understand, and everyone else does, that I am
not referring to these persons as Communists. They are not. And I
make no inference of that kind. I simply recite the fact that here
was an organization which was capable of exerting a great deal of
political power, and it attracted all persons who had political ambitions.
As a matter of fact, there were some Republicans as well as
Democrats and Independents who beat a path to the door of the Washington
Commonwealth Federation to obtain political endorsement.</p>

<p>Now this convention in 1936, in April, had before it several important
policy questions. At that particular time the Communist
Party had to exercise its influence by indirection. The top leadership
of the federation were not Communists at that time.</p>

<p>The Communist Party was striving to obtain an endorsement of
that federation convention which would call for the organization of
either a farmer-labor party or a new independent political party. In
other words, our effort, speaking of the Communists, was to drive the
federation into making a completely new, independent, separate
political organization. However, our plans were dependent upon approval
from the central committee of the Communist Party. And the
central committee of the Communist Party kept us dangling on the
end of a string for many, many weeks prior to the opening of this
convention.</p>

<p>The reason they kept us dangling on a string was that nationally
the Communist Party wanted to see organized and wanted to have a
part in organizing a new national organization which would be separate
from and independent from the Democratic Party or the Republican
Party. And it hoped to attract all persons known as liberals or
progressives to support and participate in such an organization. But
its chief difficulty was to obtain some national figure of great prominence
to lead the thing to give it the initiative and give it the original
sendoff that it needed to draw the strength necessary to win something
in the next election.</p>

<p>The party leadership felt that the person most capable of accomplishing
that purpose and fulfilling that objective was the then Governor
of Minnesota. I think it is Minnesota. Yes. His name was
Floyd Olson. He was Governor there. And he was a Farmer-Labor
Governor there.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span></p>

<p>The very designation lent itself to the spreading of a nationwide
farmer-labor party. And it was the original hope of the Communist
Party that through various forms of manipulation&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It was the Olson from Minnesota. I am quite sure, thinking back
on it now, it was Floyd.</p>

<p>But be that as it may, it was the Governor Olson of Minnesota who
was Governor in 1936 as a Farmer-Labor Governor.</p>

<p>However, at the very last moment when we had the resolution all
ready to press before the convention, we finally received word that
this Governor Olson was not well enough to undertake the job of
organizing a new national farmer-labor party because of ill health,
and begged off from the responsibility. Nationally, we were unable
to find another figure of as much prominence whom we thought would
be capable of leading such a successful effort. Consequently, we had
to whip our party machinery into shape rather rapidly and change
our tactics right on the floor of the WCF convention, and reverse
ourselves in the process of debating the question.</p>

<p>Actually the resolutions committee had come in with a report in
which a majority had objected to going the independent route. But
I was one of the delegates who was in the minority who was leading
a fight for going the independent route. And in the process of starting
the debate we got the official word that it was a hopeless task, and we
had to withdraw that effort.</p>

<p>We made a last-minute switch in our strategy and tactics, and some
of those who had been fighting us so vigorously on the floor were completely
dumfounded to find that we compromised&mdash;what appeared to
be a compromise&mdash;when we changed our policy during the course of
the debate on the resolution itself and withdrew our minority position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you change your policy as a result of directions
from the Communist Party head in New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes. And the district organizer of the party was
in the anteroom of the convention hall, sending word and direction to
those of us who were up near the microphone who had an opportunity
to command the microphone and the debate. And there were runners
running back and forth to us rather rapidly telling us what the latest
news of the party line was.</p>

<p>And the executive secretary of the Commonwealth Federation at
that time was a man by the name of Howard Costigan who became
somewhat alarmed to see such an obvious maneuver where between
15 and 20 different people were running back and forth passing messages
to me and to others up in the front from Rappaport advising
us what the official party policy was. He later on commented that he
could see the party line running all over the place, but he didn’t know
what was in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was Howard Costigan a member of the Communist
Party at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Not at that time.</p>

<p>But that demonstration of power that we exercised in that convention
was very convincing to him that if he wanted to remain as head
of that organization he would have to make his peace with us, which
he did before that summer was over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And did he become a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. He did.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I think the record should show that
Mr. Howard Costigan has appeared before the committee and has
testified regarding some of the matters which have been mentioned
here, including the fact that he did become a member of the Communist
Party at about the time indicated by this witness, and at a
later time, at approximately 1940, he left the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I could substantiate that.</p>

<p>There was another matter which arose as a serious issue in that
convention, and it concerned a proposal for an initiative measure
which became known as the production-for-use initiative.</p>

<p>Many people, because of the Communist Party influence in the
unemployed days, were quite concerned and alarmed over the problem
of unemployment, insecurity, possible impoverishment, et cetera. All
the consequences of economic dislocation. They had read many of
the so-called utopian pieces of literature such as Bellamy’s Looking
Backward and other documents of the kind. They had also read
Mr. Upton Sinclair’s program in California. They were somewhat
acquainted with the propaganda of the Soviet Union, to the effect
that production-for-use was the solution to the problems of capitalist
lack of planning. In other words, planned economy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Mr. Dennett, you testified that you received the party
line by courier, by runners from Rappaport. Do you have any idea
how Rappaport received it from headquarters of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes. Sometimes he received it by telegraph. In
this particular instance, about this Governor Olson, he received that
by telegram.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Was there any secrecy involved, especially at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. No; there was no secrecy in that communication. As
a matter of fact, they took parallel measures to see that somebody
in Governor Olson’s staff also sent word to Howard Costigan directly.
He also received the word. So that there was parallel information.
At least we did make that concession to Costigan, that he would have
official information about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did the rank-and-file membership of the Washington
Commonwealth Federation know of the Communist Party manipulations
which you have just described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I am quite sure that most of them did not, although
the behavior of many of the Democratic Party leaders at that convention
would lead me to believe that they suspected it, because they
fought us so bitterly and so hard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Proceed, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The story on the production-for-use initiative is
simply this:</p>

<p>Because there was such a popular demand for some change in the
economic situation to assure continued production and a cooperative
effort, many people tried to translate an ideal of a cooperative commonwealth
into some form of legislative effort. This resulted in
many conferences and the calling in of legal talent to try to draft a
measure which would be legal and which would satisfy the ambitions
of the people to have the so-called dream of a cooperative commonwealth
organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Describe in a practical sense what production-for-use
meant?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I wish I could satisfy you completely on that point
because that is one of the problems we ran into in trying to draw up
this initiative measure.</p>

<p>We could never satisfy ourselves that we had it satisfactorily organized.
However, the staff who worked on it worked long and hard and
finally produced a measure which was known as the production-for-use
initiative. It was ready for presentation to that convention.
However, some of us in the Communist Party, while we agreed that
such a measure was a good propaganda weapon and felt that it was an
excellent means of popularizing the ideas which we understood and
claimed were the basis of the operation of the economy in the Soviet
Union, we were startled when we read the document and found that
it sounded a little bit more like the Fascist corporate state that the
Italian leader Mussolini had established. We became so alarmed
about it, and were so perplexed that we asked a very world-famous
person, who happened to be a guest of the convention, what this
person thought about it.</p>

<p>The person to whom I refer is Anna Louise Strong, who had just
come from the Soviet Union, extended greetings to us, to the convention,
and otherwise gave a very enlightening report on her travels,
and won wide acclaim for that effort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did she, on the floor of the convention, address herself
to the problem of production-for-use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. She did not. Not at that moment. She spoke only
in general terms about it, referring to it in a complimentary way and
hoping for success. But at that moment she did not know very much
about what was in that document.</p>

<p>However, we felt that she, coming from the Soviet Union with fresh
knowledge, might know quite a lot about it and might be able to assist
us in revising the document so that it would be possible to satisfy us
that it was, in fact, a step in the direction of a cooperative commonwealth.</p>

<p>So she consented very graciously to take the document and work on
it overnight. She did exactly that. And we read it the next morning,
and, much to our surprise, she had moved the emphasis in the
control even more in the direction of top control and less in the direction
of allowing the members or the organizations to have anything
to say about it, which was just the reverse of the trend that we had
hoped for.</p>

<p>Consequently, we began to ask ourselves, that is, the Communists
asked themselves, if this is the end result of an effort to draw up an
initiative, maybe it would be smarter politically for us to see that this
measure dies aborning. Consequently, we came to the conclusion that
it was impossible to draw up an initiative measure which would be
adequate and which would answer our propaganda needs and our
desires to satisfy us that it was in harmony with our program. So we
embarked upon a campaign in the course of the election&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was this a campaign to pass the proposed measure
or to defeat it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Well, we all went out presumably to win support
to get the measure adopted. That is, it was an initiative measure and
it was before the voters. The voters were to cast a vote yes or no
on this initiative.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. My counsel asked me if I knew the number of it,
and I have forgotten the exact number of that initiative at this moment.
So I can’t furnish that. I wish I could. It is a matter of official
record, however, and it can be verified if anyone is curious about
it.</p>

<p>The Communist Party found itself in that predicament. We were
committed to support the measure, but we were determined to bring
about its defeat. Consequently, we campaigned far and wide all over
the State of Washington, explaining the measure in such a way as to
convince the people that they should not vote for it.</p>

<p>At the same time we represented ourselves as campaigning for the
measure.</p>

<p>And we did it so successfully that the measure was defeated. If
we hadn’t of done it I am afraid it would have been adopted.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. My counsel asked me who was the “we.”</p>

<p>I am referring to the Communist Party in that instance.</p>

<p>The leaders of the Washington Commonwealth Federation were
terribly disturbed by the nature of the campaign that we were carrying
on, that is, the Communists.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I should think it would be a rather confusing campaign
where the Communist Party, in order to defeat it, actually supported
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is true. It was very confusing to everyone,
even to us at times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That is a very interesting thing. The Communist
Party, in order to defeat this measure, went out and conducted a state-wide
campaign in favor of it. But in order to accomplish its defeat,
if I understand you correctly, the Communist Party so represented
the issues that people would be bound to vote against it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. I understood the situation to be that because of Communist
Party support of the measure, the public sentiment opposed
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Not necessarily so, sir, because they didn’t know that
we who were speaking were Communists. They thought we were
representatives of the Washington Commonwealth Federation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. There is triple deception in this maneuver, which
is rather hard to follow. I hope I have explained it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am afraid that the point may not be absolutely
clear in the record, and I want to be sure that it is clear:</p>

<p>If I understand you correctly, it was not the fact that the Communist
Party was supporting this measure that caused its defeat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. You are correct, sir. That was not the reason. It
was the way we, as disguised Communists, carried on the campaign,
ostensibly for it, but, in fact, against it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In other words, your representations were of such
a character as to make known the weaknesses in the bill; and a person
would actually think you were supporting it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. True. You understand it quite clearly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I think the bill was properly named when you used
the word “initiative” because that certainly is the use of initiative.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
I am glad to know it is Communist Party initiative. It is a very
deceptive type of campaign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Mr. Tavenner and Mr. Chairman, I would like to
make one observation about my testimony earlier this afternoon.</p>

<p>I get the feeling, and I have a fear that perhaps people listening
to this presentation might think that because of my testimony I was
the only figure who was active in the Washington Commonwealth
Federation carrying on this activity.</p>

<p>I hope that no one assumes that because I was one of a team. There
were several others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Who composed the team?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Well, I didn’t mean to bring that up because I don’t
like to have to do that. But I was fearful that people might think
I was too much of a braggart in this thing, and I don’t mean to be
because it is all ancient history and I am simply trying to furnish
such information as I know of my own knowledge about that experience
so that other people may comprehend it in full.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am sure, Mr. Dennett, that the committee, having
heard as many witnesses as it has on the subject of communism, recognizes
that it is teamwork that has enabled the Communist Party to
get where it is, rather than grandstand playing.</p>

<p>Who were the other members of the team?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Well, that takes me into a description of the district
bureau of the Communist Party in that particular period.</p>

<p>As I look back over it I might call it the golden age of the Communist
Party’s efforts in the Northwest because it did at that time
enjoy, that is, the leaders of the Communist Party did enjoy a relationship
among each other and among themselves, and in the organizations
to which each were members&mdash;they did enjoy a very full and
rich democratic experience in procedure.</p>

<p>This, I think, was due largely to the efforts of Mr. Morris Rappaport
who was the district organizer whom I mentioned earlier, who
had, by his adroitness in calling the political moves, established himself
in the eyes of the central committee of the Communist Party of
the United States as a person capable of directing the political activities
in the Northwest without the need of daily supervision on the part
of national headquarters of the Communist Party. In other words,
they did accord him the recognition that comes of confidence that he
knew what he was doing and was capable of carrying it out.</p>

<p>And I am quite certain that the way he coordinated the efforts of
each of us in the district bureau at that time were so gratifying to
the central committee that most of the members of the central committee
didn’t dare to try to interfere with our efforts for fear that they
might be responsible for upsetting the applecart so to speak.</p>

<p>Now in that team were, first of all, Mr. Morris Rappaport, the
district organizer. His right-hand man, who was also the trade-union
secretary of the district, was a man known to me by the name of Henry
or Harry Jackson. I know that that is not his real name, but I do
not know what his real name was. That was his party name. That
is the only name I knew him by in this area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How long was he in this area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. He came shortly after Morris Rappaport came.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did he come from New York?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. He did. His original home was San Francisco.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am sure we know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Mr. Jackson had his early training in the Marine
Workers Industrial Union organizing maritime workers. He came
here originally for that purpose, and then his assignment was switched
to that of trade-union secretary for the district in the Northwest.</p>

<p>I was one of his closest associates because I was footloose and free
and available to carry the Jimmy Higgins load that had to be carried
at that time. We were working daily and devoting all of our time
to that effort.</p>

<p>We had a few people who were prominent in the University of
Washington at that time who were active members of our district
bureau. One was Mr. Harold Ebey, E-b-e-y.</p>

<p>And another was Mr. Hugh DeLacy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was he at one time a Member of Congress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, he is the same person who was called
as a witness before this committee at Dayton, Ohio, in September 1954,
and who refused to answer material questions on the ground that to
do so might tend to incriminate him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I mentioned Mr. DeLacy’s name with a great deal of
regret because I was a very close associate of Mr. DeLacy and I had
a great deal of respect for him, and he for me. It is only under the
compulsion of the subpena and the fact that I am testifying and I
have to testify when I mention his name. I do so with regret. I wish
the rules were such that it wasn’t necessary because it is a source of
great embarrassment to me. But I feel that I owe a big obligation
to the men that I work for, and, under the rules as constituted by this
committee and the way it is operating, I have no choice in the matter.</p>

<p>I make my apologies to Mr. DeLacy for having to do this. I regret
it. But at the same time, in the long run, I don’t think it is going
to hurt him, and I think it may do him some good. I hope so.</p>

<p>Others who were prominent in the district bureau were, of course,
Mr. Howard Costigan, Mr. Jess Fletcher, Mr. William K. Dobbins,
Mr. Karley Larsen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Let me make this suggestion to you.</p>

<p>If you know whether any of these persons whose names you have
mentioned, testified publicly before this or other committees and acknowledged
their Communist Party membership and a withdrawal
from the Communist Party, I think you should state it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I can state that about three persons whom I know.
I know that Mr. Jess Fletcher separated from the Communist Party,
and he has testified in a number of instances. He began testifying
before the Canwell committee when he was separated from the Communist
Party and from his union as a consequence of that fight. He
later testified before a number of Government agencies in a number
of court cases.</p>

<p>Mr. Howard Costigan testified before this committee. I read his
testimony in the proceedings which have been published by the committee.</p>

<p>Mr. Harold Ebey also appeared before the Canwell committee and
testified there. He is out of the Communist Party and has been for
quite a considerable period of time. At least, I believe, since this
period 1936, 1937, and 1938.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span></p>

<p>Costigan is out of the Communist Party. He left shortly after
later political difficulties arose, which I will soon get into.</p>

<p>There may have been a few others who were in and out of the district
bureau. This district bureau was the leading body, the leading
organ in the district. It was the top body which had the top authority
to determine party policy in this area.</p>

<p>At one time I believe there were about 12 or 14 members of this
bureau. It may have been confined to nine. I have some recollection
that there were nine members officially on the bureau, but there were a
few who were candidates. That is, they were the next alternates to
become members in the event of any vacancy on the bureau so that we
could always have a reserve to fill any vacancies which might occur.</p>

<p>That district bureau covered the Northwest area which were the
States of, at that time, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do I understand you to mean that it was that group
of individuals who took the leadership in the work within the Washington
Commonwealth Federation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes; they did.</p>

<p>Mr. Rappaport could not directly participate in the work of the
Washington Commonwealth Federation because he was what was
generally called the face of the party. He was the official representative
of the party. And the Washington Commonwealth Federation,
even though there were Communist leaders in it, it at no time accepted
an affiliation from the Communist Party, and it at no time would
acknowledge a Communist as a Communist in the organization unless
it be someone like Rappaport who had the authority to represent the
party as such.</p>

<p>By that I mean that if I presented myself to the Washington Commonwealth
Federation to speak on any matter or to urge anything
before its body, I could not speak in the name of the Communist
Party even though other members of that executive board may know
that I was a member of the Communist Party. I could not speak as
a Communist. I could only speak as a member of that executive board,
and it was the presumption that I was representing the affiliate from
which I had been sent as a delegate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you tell the committee, please, which of these
Communist Party bureau members became officials in the Washington
Commonwealth Federation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Mr. Costigan already was an official. He was the
executive secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. DeLacy became the president of the Washington Commonwealth
Federation.</p>

<p>I became the vice president of the Washington Commonwealth
Federation.</p>

<p>Mr. Harold Ebey served in some advisory capacity. I think that
he came from a teachers’ union affiliate at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. Dobbins was a member there, but I do not recall the exact
relation that he held to obtain his position.</p>

<p>Mr. Karley Larsen was a leader there by virtue of the fact that
he was a leader in the Northern Washington District Council of the
International Woodworkers of America.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It would seem that the Communist Party had complete
control of the organization.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. We had another person there who is now deceased,
but I don’t think that it gives a complete picture without mentioning
him, and that is Mr. William Pennock, because Bill Pennock was the
workhorse. Bill Pennock carried the load. He was a very efficient
man, one of the fastest shorthand artists that I ever knew, and was
capable of keeping up with the fast pace that Mr. Costigan set.</p>

<p>Mr. Pennock deserves honorable mention for the work that he did
in that setup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What position did Pennock hold in the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. He attended the bureau meetings, but I do not remember
exactly whether he was a member of the bureau. But he
attended most of the bureau meetings by virtue of the fact that he
became the head of the pension union which was one of the big affiliates
of the Washington Commonwealth Federation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You have given a very full description of how the
Communist Party maneuvered to capture this organization.</p>

<p>Why was the Communist Party so interested in obtaining control
of the Washington Commonwealth Federation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Because we wanted to ultimately obtain political
power for the Communist Party in the United States of America.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In the same manner, I assume, that you were attempting
to gain power for the Communist Party in every other
field of endeavor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Of course.</p>

<p>My counsel has suggested that I indicate the total membership of
the Washington Commonwealth Federation in that period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes, I think you should.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I am unable to give that in exact numbers, but I can
give you a proportionate situation which may indicate something of
value.</p>

<p>It was our estimate and the result of our study from the election
returns of the candidates that we endorsed and the propositions that
we supported&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. When you say “we” are you speaking of the Communist
Party or the Washington Commonwealth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The Washington Commonwealth Federation.</p>

<p>It was our estimate that it was capable of influencing and obtaining
the vote of one-third of the members who voted in the Democratic
Party slate or side of the ticket. And because of that fact and because
we were in a higher state of mobilization than the rest of the
Democratic Party, when primaries came along we could exercise a
more direct influence in the primaries than anybody else because our
members in the Washington Commonwealth Federation had a greater
zeal and a greater devotion to carrying out their objectives than
the other Democrats who frequently relied upon making their decisions
in the general elections.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. What do you mean by other Democrats?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Those who voted in the Democratic Party who were
not members of the Washington Commonwealth Federation through
affiliation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. How many Communists would you estimate were
members of the Washington Commonwealth Federation?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The nearest I can give you by indication of that is
that in the period 1937-38, the high point of membership in the Communist
Party, as I recall the reports made to the district bureau by
the organization secretary, was in the neighborhood of 5,500 members
of the Communist Party in the Northwest, in the 3 States of Oregon,
Washington, and Idaho, and Alaska, the Territory of Alaska. Those
5,500 members of course, were scattered throughout all the other
organizations in the Northwest. And I am firmly of the belief that
fully 90 to 95 percent of that were members of the Washington Commonwealth
Federation through affiliations of one kind or another.</p>

<p>(At this point Representative Morgan M. Moulder left the hearing
room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did the Washington Commonwealth Federation
extend throughout the entire 12th district, or, that is, in the Northwest
area? Or was it confined only to the State of Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. It was confined to the State of Washington. However,
there were some efforts made in the State of Oregon to develop
an Oregon Commonwealth Federation, but I have no direct knowledge
of that, and I would be unqualified to give you any testimony about
it because I did not participate in it and I do not know the people
who did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span> (presiding). Did your district committee of the Communist
Party, however, have representatives from Alaska and from
Oregon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. No, there was no territorial representation like that.
The representatives of the district bureau of the Communist Party
were chosen because of their capability as political leaders, not because
of any particular area that they came from. And it was determined
largely by their ability to influence public opinion and to intervene
in the decision of public affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did the district bureau act for the 12th district of the
Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes, it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. But were they all from the State of Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is true. I think perhaps it is necessary at this
point to clear up one little problem of organizational structure that
existed in the Communist Party at that time.</p>

<p>It was not based upon territory. Representatives of the higher
committees did not have to come from any particular territory. They
were chosen because of their availability and their influencing ability
to carry the party policy into the mass organizations or before the
public.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Were they actually chosen by the national committee
of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Not in this district they were not, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Just how were they chosen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Well, that is another organizational problem of
interorganization of the Communist Party which is rather difficult
for persons not familiar with it to comprehend. But let me try to do
it as briefly as possible this way.</p>

<p>When I first came into the Communist Party the usual procedure
was something that went under the title of “Cooption.” Cooption
meant that the district organizer could appoint anybody he wanted
to the district committee or to the district bureau and could call them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
in to serve, and everybody else had to accept such a person as being
a fully qualified member of that body. In other words, it was a
handpicked staff which represented the wishes of that particular
leader who held the authority at that time. That was the process
of cooption in the event of a vacancy. He could appoint someone
to fill that vacancy, and he did so. It was his responsibility to do so.</p>

<p>However, with the rise of Hitler Germany, the trials of the Reichstag,
an international leader by the name of Dimitrov acquired world
fame because, in his defense against the frameup which Goering
tried to put over on him, he learned that the Communist tactics and
the Communist policies in Germany had turned the masses of German
workers against the Communist Party and had resulted or had certainly
played a part in contributing to making it possible for Hitler
Germany to result with Hitler’s ascension to power.</p>

<p>Therefore, Mr. Dimitrov, when offered asylum by the Soviet Government,
immediately went to work for the Comintern, and, in that
capacity as leader of the Comintern, brought forth what was known
as a new line. And that new line called for introducing the practice
of democracy into the ranks of the Communist Party organization.
He urged and advised that the practice of cooption be abolished, and
that the higher committees be elected by a democratic process. And
he, in fact, insisted that that must be done in all countries where the
party was not illegal.</p>

<p>Recognizing that it was not possible to hold conventions where the
party was illegal, and that applied especially to the United States,
when Mr. Rappaport came to this district he tried his best to follow
out the decisions which were laid down by the Communist International
and the national headquarters of the Communist Party, and
that practice of electing the leadership was followed. However, at
the district convention there was always a nominating committee who
carefully screened the names of persons who were being proposed for
leadership or election to these committees, and, in doing so, succeeded
in accomplishing the original result, only satisfying ourselves that we
were practicing democracy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. What year did that change take place, Mr. Dennett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Right around 1936.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. So the matter of making nominations through a
committee was a mere matter of form.</p>

<p>(At this point Representative Morgan M. Moulder returned to the
hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The district organizers still carefully looked it over
and still had a controlling influence there. But in this particular case
Mr. Rappaport exercised his influence not in any arbitrary way but in
a convincing way, because we all recognized that his broader experience
and his tremendous capacity for work equipped him to give us
the benefit of better wisdom than we had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Going back to the Washington Commonwealth
Federation, you were asked a question as to what the membership of
the Communist Party was in the district. Do you know what the
membership of the Communist Party was in the State of Washington
at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Well, most of that membership was in the State of
Washington. And I don’t know the exact number, but I think it would
be quite safe to say that around 85 to 90 percent of it was in the State
of Washington.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How long did the Communist Party succeed in
bringing its influence to bear on political elections through this organization
known as the Washington Commonwealth Federation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Until the international situation became unstable in
about the year 1938.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How did the international situation affect political
matters locally here in the State of Washington as far as the Communist
Party was concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The Communist Party had as one of its principal
objectives and one of its chief propaganda weapons, which it used
upon other persons of political mindedness, that the Communist
program was a consistent program on a domestic policy and on foreign
policy, that our program was liberal domestically and liberal internationally.
However, in 1938, after a long period of struggle and effort,
the Communist Party succeeded in prevailing upon many people to
accept the slogan of collective security as the proper policy to pursue in
foreign affairs. That, of course, was quite consistent with the policy
of the Soviet Union because it was the Soviet delegates to the League
of Nations who had continually agitated for a policy of collective
security.</p>

<p>I think it was some time in 1938 that the Italian Premier launched
his attack in Ethiopia, and while we were clamoring for collective
security to be applied to that situation, it wasn’t too long afterwards
when the Soviet Union had a serious dispute with Finland, and hostilities
broke out and the Soviet Union smashed the Finnish Army and
the Finnish military installations.</p>

<p>We were confronted with the necessity of making an immediate
switch demanding nonintervention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What do you mean by we?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The Communist Party.</p>

<p>So our insistence upon nonintervention contradicted our prior insistence
upon collective security. This presented no end of trouble,
especially to those who had to meet the public and had to answer to
the public for the consistency of their program and policies from one
day to the next. It ultimately led to the disaffection of Mr. Howard
Costigan. And the chief reason that Mr. Costigan disaffected at that
time was because of his loyalty to Franklin D. Roosevelt as then President
of the United States, who came out in bitter denunciation
against the Soviets for attacking Finland, which left him in the position
of having a consistent policy because he had complained bitterly
against Mussolini’s march into Ethiopia. He had also been critical
of the Japanese invasion of China. He had also been critical of each
military venture where one country had attempted to impose its will
upon another by military means.</p>

<p>So Costigan felt that he was on sounder ground to continue his
support of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and he did so with as much effort
as he dared, without bringing down the wrath of the Communist Party
on him at that particular moment. However, the Communist Party
sensed that he was beginning to disaffect, and we proceeded to isolate
him from everything we could. I mean the Communists proceeded to
isolate Mr. Costigan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was this the period when the Communist Party
was crying from the rooftops that the President of the United States
was a warmonger?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes, it was. I am a little bit fearful that if anyone
looks at the record very carefully they will find that I made a few
speeches on that subject myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In other words, as a result of the international
situation the Communist Party had gotten itself into a position which
adversely affected its interests locally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is very true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the result of that adverse effect upon
the Communist Party locally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The most damaging effect to the Communist Party
was that it shook the faith of many of those who were members of
the district bureau at that time. I must admit that I tried to present
the appearance myself of not losing faith in the integrity of the
Soviet foreign policy. However, I must also admit that there was
a little bit of deception in that for the reason that I could not completely
justify it, no matter how hard I tried, and I found that Mr.
Costigan became very bitter about it. I found also that Mr. Ebey
had a few misgivings. He didn’t express them at that time too sharply
because he is a very mild-mannered sort of person. But those of us
who were in the rough and tough political battles put on a case-hardened
outward appearance which was intended to inspire the ranks
to hold the line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the final result?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The final result was that various organizations affiliated
to the Washington Commonwealth Federation found their
political conviction to be inconsistent with the official policy expressed
by disguised Communist leaders in the Washington Commonwealth
Federation. So that many of them began to disaffiliate and leave
the organization, so that it did not embrace the commanding minority
which it had previously had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In other words, your position of control in that
organization was weakened, if not virtually destroyed, by this disaffection
that had arisen within the Communist Party ranks largely
as a result of international problems.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is very true.</p>

<p>Those of us who presented what might be referred to as a case-hardened
outward appearance did so largely in the hope and faith
that our loyalty to the Soviet Union under those circumstances would
be rewarded by the Soviet Union remaining loyal and true to the
socialist ideals which all of us held.</p>

<p>However, at a later date, after the Second World War, just to make
the comment without going into detail at this moment, many began
to find out through their experience in the Army and military efforts,
and through persons who traveled abroad and came into contact
directly with the Russian military effort&mdash;many became convinced
that there was a considerable difference between the democracy that
had been preached about in the Soviet Union and the actual practice
which they found.</p>

<p>Also there was a serious disillusionment when large numbers of
soldiers learned, to their dismay, that even during the war period
the Soviet Union had in labor camps very large numbers of persons
who were held in those camps as political prisoners, a policy which
we had been led to believe, through all the official propaganda, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
the Communist Party in the Soviet Union wouldn’t possibly indulge
in such a practice, that only the capitalist countries would practice
such a heinous crime.</p>

<p>But it was a terrible shock and disillusionment when large numbers
of people found, out of their own direct knowledge, that these huge
forced labor camps did in fact exist and that people who were committed
to them were committed to them for terms ranging from 25
years to life instead of the official propaganda which has been preached,
to the effect that no sentence was over 10 years in length in the Soviet
Union. And we found there was a great deal of difference between
fact and fancy.</p>

<p>(At this point Representative Harold H. Velde left the hearing
room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Is the Washington Commonwealth Federation in
existence today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. It is not. It was liquidated by the Communist Party
leadership during the Second World War.</p>

<p>In my records there will be found some correspondence between
Hugh DeLacy and myself because I was a vice president of the federation,
but I was in the military service at the time this disillusion
took place.</p>

<p>Mr. DeLacy had written me something about it, and I disagreed with
it. He had also written to me suggesting that since I was in the military
service maybe it would be better for me to give up my share of
stock which entitled me to be a member of the board of directors of
the New World, which was the official newspaper published under the
federation at that time.</p>

<p>I found occasion to disagree violently with him over the suggestion
for the reason that I felt that those who were in the armed services
should not be removed from their official positions because they were
in the armed services. I felt that they were more entitled to continue
their representation on the organization because they were in the
armed services.</p>

<p>We had an exchange of correspondence there which was quite acrimonious
at points, and I am amazed when I look back at it and see
how it developed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I believe this is a satisfactory point
to suspend the examination of this witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Yes, Mr. Dennett. We thank you for your patience
and the information which you have given the committee. We are endeavoring,
whenever possible, to give you a rest so there will not be
this long stress upon you for a long period of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I appreciate that. In my younger days I used to
have a marathon endurance, but I find I don’t have it any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you wish to call another witness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Lawrence Earl George.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Will you hold up your right hand and be sworn,
please.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you are about
to give before this committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you, God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. I do.

<h3 id="Lawrence_Earl_George414">TESTIMONY OF LAWRENCE EARL GEORGE, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS
COUNSEL, PHILIP L. BURTON</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Will the witness state his full name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. My name is Lawrence Earl George.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Where do you reside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. Seattle, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Will counsel identify himself for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burton</span>. My name is Philip L. Burton. I am a Seattle attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Mr. George, what is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. I am a warehouseman, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. How long have you been a warehouseman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. Oh, for 12, 15 years; 12 years anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Being a warehouseman, are you a member of any
union?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. Sir, upon advice of counsel, I will invoke my rights
and privileges under the first and fifth amendments of the Constitution
of the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. I didn’t hear your reply. Did you say you decline
to answer the question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. Because of certain insinuations about any union, it
is necessary for me to invoke my rights under the first and fifth
amendments of the Constitution and decline to answer the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Have you held any positions in the union that we
are discussing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. Again, sir, I shall have to invoke the fifth amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Is it not a fact that the warehousemen are members
of the International Longshoreman’s and Warehousemen’s Union?
I am not asking you if you are a member of the ILWU; just a blanket
question.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. Yes; that is a fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Are you a member of the International Longshoremen’s
and Warehousemen’s Union?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. Again, sir, I have to invoke my privileges under the
fifth amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Have you at any time during your residency in
Seattle been acquainted with a lady by the name of Barbara Hartle?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. Again, sir, I shall have to invoke my privileges under
the fifth amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Mrs. Hartle testified before this committee last June
that she knew you as a member of the waterfront section of the Communist
Party. Is that correct?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. Again, Mr. Chairman, I have to invoke the privileges
granted me under the fifth amendment of the Constitution.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Will you also invoke the privilege on all questions
relating to the waterfront section of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. I shall have to invoke my privileges under the fifth
amendment in connection with that.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Were you an official of the union in 1951?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. Again I have to invoke my privileges under the fifth
amendment and decline to answer the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Did you sign a Taft-Hartley affidavit?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. I invoke my privileges under the fifth amendment and
decline to answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Is it not a fact that the Communist Party advised
members of the Communist Party to disassociate themselves from the
Communist Party and sign the Taft-Hartley affidavit?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. I shall have to invoke my privileges under the fifth
amendment to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Is it not a fact that the members of the Communist
Party remained loyal and in the discipline of the Communist Party
although they officially did resign?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. I will have to invoke my privileges under the fifth
amendment as to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Did I understand you to say that your birthplace
was here in Seattle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. Sir, I didn’t give my place of birth. I wasn’t asked
that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. I was born in Denver, Colo.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. When did you move to Seattle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. I came to Seattle after the First World War. I think
it was in 1918 or thereabouts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Have you resided in Seattle ever since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Have you ever heard of the Negro and National
Groups Commission of the Communist Party of King County?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. I shall have to invoke my privileges under the fifth
amendment as to that, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Mrs. Hartle in her testimony stated you were chairman
of that group. Was she correct in this testimony?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. Again, sir, I will have to invoke my privileges under
the fifth amendment and decline to answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Are you familiar with an organization called the
Interracial Action Committee?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. I will have to invoke my privileges under the fifth
amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span> Are you a member of the Communist Party today,
Mr. George?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George</span>. I will have to invoke my privileges under the fifth
amendment and decline to answer that, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. No further questions, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The witness is excused.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Harriet Pierce.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span></p>

<p>(At this point Representative Harold H. Velde returned to the
hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you represent Mrs. Pierce? Will you step up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Trolson</span>. Yes, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. I want to talk to him.</p>

<p>(Whereupon Mr. Trolson conferred with the chairman.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Call the witness again, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Harriet Pierce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Would you raise your right hand and be sworn.
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you are about to
give before this committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Trolson</span>. May I make a statement before you begin to question
the witness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Yes; you may.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Trolson</span>. My name is Roy Trolson. I am a member of the
Board of Trustees of the Seattle Bar Association.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pierce has come to the bar association and rendered a statement
that she is unable to secure counsel because she has no funds for
that purpose. The president of the Bar Association has asked me to
represent Mrs. Pierce, and I want to make it clear that I am representing
her without compensation and at the request of the Legal Aid
Bureau of the Seattle Bar Association.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. We certainly appreciate your position and wish to
say that you should be commended as an attorney when requested by
the Bar Association to appear and represent any person who has no
funds to employ counsel.</p>

<p>And certainly it should have no reflection, and doesn’t have any
reflection, upon you whatsoever.</p>

<p>For a person who is unable to employ counsel, it is the duty of a
lawyer under those circumstances to comply with that request, and the
burden that has been placed upon you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Trolson</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h3 id="Harriett_Pierce416">TESTIMONY OF MRS. HARRIET PIERCE, ACCOMPANIED BY HER
COUNSEL, ROY F. TROLSON</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Will you state your full name, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Mrs. Harriet Pierce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Where do you presently reside?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. In Seattle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Are you presently employed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Where are you employed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I am employed at the Tacoma Country and Golf Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Do you have any part-time employment other than
your present position?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Would you advise the committee of your occupational
background prior to your present occupation?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with her counsel.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I wish to invoke the fifth amendment on this question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. On all prior occupation?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes, sir; that is on all prior occupation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Isn’t it a fact that you worked for the United States
Government at one time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. On this question, too, I wish to invoke the protection
of the fifth amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you mean to say that your employment in the
United States Government may tend to incriminate you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I have already stated my answer, sir.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with her counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. If investigation, Mr. Wheeler, reveals the witness’
employment, then I suggest that you ask the question according to
what your investigation has revealed, the specific questions which she
can answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Have you ever been employed by the United States
Post Office Department?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I decline to answer that question for the reasons previously
stated, sir. And I would like to explain that I fear that
answering these questions may lead to other questions which might
tend to incriminate me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Were you dismissed from this position because of
security reasons?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I decline to answer that question for the reasons previously
stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Have you been a paid employee of the Civil Rights
Congress of the city of Seattle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I decline to answer that question for the reasons previously
stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Do you know Mrs. Barbara Hartle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I decline to answer that question, sir, for the reasons
previously stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. She testified that you were a member of the Georgetown
Club of the Communist Party, King County. Is that a statement
of fact on the part of Mrs. Hartle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I decline to answer, and invoke my protection under
the fifth amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Were you active in any way with the Progressive
Party here in the State of Washington?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I decline to answer that for the reasons previously
stated, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Mr. Chairman, I think it is quite obvious that we
are not going to get the information we desire from this witness.</p>

<p>I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. May I ask the witness where you were born?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I was born in Martinsburg, W. Va.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. And when did you come to the State of Washington?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with her counsel.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I believe it was in 1942 or possibly 1943. I am not
certain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Were you married at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No, sir.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Did you have employment when you arrived or did
you have to seek employment after you arrived?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with her counsel.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. On this question, sir, I wish to invoke my privilege
under the fifth amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Mr. Chairman, I fail to see how that could possibly
tend to incriminate her or lead to incrimination. I suggest that the
witness be directed to answer the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The witness is directed to answer the question.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with her counsel.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Sir, this is a question which I would like very much
to answer, and answer fully, but I feel that it might lead either to
other questions which might incriminate me or to a waiver of my right
to claim the protection of the fifth amendment, and I therefore do
claim protection of the fifth amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Are you now a member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Again I claim the protection of the fifth amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Have you ever been a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I claim the protection of the fifth amendment on
that question, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Are you now employed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I have already answered that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Then would you care to answer again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Well, I could answer it again the same as I did before.
I am employed now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Where are you now employed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. At the Tacoma Country and Golf Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. How long have you been employed there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I decline to answer under the privilege of the fifth
amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you mean to say the length of time you have been
employed there would tend to incriminate you? Is that your reasoning
on that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I have already stated my answer, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Any questions, Mr. Velde?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Dennett, will you come forward, please.</p>

<p>When your testimony was suspended yesterday we were inquiring
into the activity of the Washington Commonwealth Federation. In
the course of your testimony on that subject no mention was made
of the Workers Alliance.</p>

<p>To what extent was the Workers Alliance affiliated with that
organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. It was one of the principal affiliates in the early
days, and it had regular representatives on the Washington Commonwealth
Federation board. One of the most prominent of those was a
person by the name of Harry C. Armstrong, who was better known
as Army Armstrong. He later became a legislator, and I think he
was at one time the head of the Workers Alliance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. At the time he was head of the Workers Alliance
and active in the Washington Commonwealth Federation was he also
a member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. At first he was not. But the Workers Alliance, of
course, was one of the organizations in which the Communist Party
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
worked very actively, and ultimately Mr. Armstrong became a member
of the Communist Party. I knew him when he was a member of the
Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was he active in Communist Party affairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes, he was quite active in the Communist Party
affairs for a short time. He later had differences with the party over
policy, and became too much of a Democrat to suit the Communists,
and came to a parting of the ways with the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Can you give us the names of any other individuals,
active in the work of the Washington Commonwealth Federation or
any of its component parts, who were known to you to be members of
the Communist Party during that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Well, my random recollection is a little bit too unreliable
to go on. I think that I mentioned all of the principal ones
yesterday with the exception of Mr. Armstrong, whom I have
explained this morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. During the period that the organizational work was
being done by the Communist Party within the Washington Commonwealth
Federation was there in existence in the State of Washington
an organization known as the Washington Pension Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is correct, there was. That was a organization
which came into existence principally because the Governor of
the State had ordered some cuts in the pension, or the assistance to the
old-age groups. It was prior to the organization of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Prior to the organization of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Of the union, of the Old-Age Pension Union.</p>

<p>It seems as though there was an attempt to cut on the relief, and
some of the relief authorities thought that they could cut the benefits
to the elderly people and there would be little protest for it. But
Howard Costigan, being very alert to the political possibilities, spoke
about it on the radio and, in response to that speaking, received many,
many calls by telephone and by letter asking him to do something
about it. He didn’t know what to do.</p>

<p>He came to the party of people and explained to us afterward that
he was perplexed but he was going to call a mass meeting and ask these
people to come and make their protests in public.</p>

<p>He did exactly that. The meeting was overwhelmingly successful;
far more elderly people arrived than he expected. The hall was
packed to overflowing, and he had to call more meetings to satisfy
their desire to express their protest. During the course of that,
Costigan, not knowing what else to do, suggested that they set up a
permanent committee to continue their protest against this form of
relief cut. The old-age people responded so vigorously that they
themselves determined that they must have a union. And they chose
the name of Old-Age Pension Union.</p>

<p>At first, I believe, Costigan was not an officer of it. As a matter of
fact, he felt that he had more than he could carry handling the work
of the Washington Commonwealth Federation. So he asked the
party people to find him some help to see if he could carry on this
extra work that needed to be done. And, through the efforts of Mr.
Lowell Wakefield, they found a person by the name of William J.
Pennock who was a very able man. And Bill Pennock assisted Costigan
in all of his work when he was in the Washington Commonwealth
Federation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span></p>

<p>Later when the time came to organize the Old-Age Pension Union,
Pennock assisted Costigan in finding people to head up that organization.</p>

<p>(At this point Representative Morgan M. Moulder entered the
hearing room and assumed the chair.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. In the very beginning the original leaders who held
the original titles of president and vice president of the Old-Age
Pension Union were not members of the Communist Party. They
were chosen by these old-age pension people, knowing them to be
public-spirited persons, and I don’t know whether it is proper to
identify those persons or not at this point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. No. The committee would not be interested in going
into that phase of the matter.</p>

<p>You mentioned a person by the name of Lowell Wakefield. Will
you tell the committee what you know of his activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Lowell Wakefield was a member of the Communist
Party. He did come from the East on his assignment by the central
committee to work in this district. However, after he had worked
here a comparatively short time he came into dispute with the succeeding
leader who came, Mr. Morris Rappaport, and ultimately Mr.
Wakefield left the Communist Party and I believe that he has had
no connection with the Communist Party for a great many years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The point you are making is that in its inception
this union, the Old-Age Pension Union, was not of a Communist
origin or of a Communist character.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. No; it was not. But the Communist Party recognized
that the terrific response that Costigan received meant that
here was a potential group of people capable of doing enormous
amounts of political work.</p>

<p>Remember, please, their situation: They were retired; they had
ceased working daily on a job. Therefore, they had the leisure time
to do what they wanted to do in most instances or at least in many instances.
The result was that some of these people could go out and
peddle leaflets and knock on doors. They constituted an enormous
political strength. And the Communist Party conceived the idea that
these people certainly would be the most able people to carry on political
programs if they could be won to support such a program.</p>

<p>So the Communist Party set about to do exactly that in the pension
union.</p>

<p>Among those who were urged to go into the pension union to work
vigorously was a person by the name of Thomas C. Rabbitt.</p>

<p>Tom Rabbitt became a very powerful and influential man in that
organization. He did so very largely because he succeeded in being
elected to the Washington State Legislature as a Democrat, and, in
the State legislature as a State senator, was able to embarrass the
governor and the administration on their promises to aid the elderly
people on the pension program. His efforts were heralded as making
a real&mdash;well, he was considered to be a real political leader because he
had succeeded in a situation where it was vitally important.</p>

<p>My counsel reminds me that Mr. Rabbitt has been before this committee,
and he appeared in your executive session last June.</p>

<p>Mr. Rabbitt found that there was an enormous amount of work to
be done in that organization, and he had to call for help. And he
built up a comparatively important machine with which he worked.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You have told us that the Communist Party, upon
seeing the great potentialities in this new organization, decided to do
something about it. Tell the committee just what it did and the
methods it used to gain control of the Old-Age Pension Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. It concentrated first at the top levels of the organization.
It wanted to get strong leadership there capable of carrying
two important points: first, that they carry on a relentless struggle
for better and more welfare assistance to the aged people so as to
insure their loyalty and support among those members; they wanted,
next, to be certain that a large body of people became ardent supporters
and friends of the Soviet Union so that it would be possible to
defend the political policies of the Communist Party in that respect
and to give assistance to the Communist program in this area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, as indicated by his testimony, the
knowledge of this witness is very great concerning the scientific features
of communism and how it operates in the Northwest.</p>

<p>Because of the limit of time, we have had to confine ourselves to
the high spots. I will ask, if we are to conclude his testimony today,
that Mr. Dennett confine his testimony chiefly to his own activities and
circumstances surrounding them; otherwise we will be unable to complete
what we had planned today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Yes. As you say, it is very important testimony.
We are grateful to receive it. I believe any additional information
which he might wish to submit could be submitted in writing to the
committee at a later date. I mean after we have concluded our
hearings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, it is obvious we will have a great
deal of work ahead of us in connection with documentary information
which he has at hand, as well as to give this witness time to explain
fully the implications of his statements today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. It may be possible when the hearings are held in Los
Angeles in June that additional hearings could be held here to complete
the testimony of Mr. Dennett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Certainly further consideration will have to be given
to that.</p>

<p>I wanted to make this explanation principally so the committee
would understand that I have asked the witness to confine his testimony
today principally to his own activities. I did not want the committee
to feel that the witness was attempting to relate what he had
done alone as a matter of his own choice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Mr. Dennett can be subpenaed to appear in California
when hearings are held there; the subcommittee could resume
hearings here at a later date if we feel it is necessary to secure his
additional information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Continuing with the subject of the old-age pension,
were you active in it in your individual capacity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. No; I was not. I spoke before it on a number of
times on invitation of the leaders to indicate some labor support because
I was representing the State CIO at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Tell us briefly to what extent was the Communist
Party successful in the accomplishment of the two purposes you stated
the Communists had in interesting the leadership of the old-age pension
unit.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. As I indicated at the outset, the first leaders of the
pension union&mdash;president, vice president, and some of the other officers&mdash;were
anti-Communist people. And it did not take too long
before they came into conflict with those Communists who were trying
to make certain that the organization carried out these purposes which
I have indicated.</p>

<p>I believe that the first president of the organization left it very
quickly. Later on another person took over as a president of the
organization, who was a member of the Communist Party, and he
remained a leader for quite a long time. Ultimately he got into conflict
with the Communist Party, and the Communist Party did what
we call a hatchet job on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Who was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. A man by the name of N. P. Atkinson. And Atkinson
was expelled from the party. And when he was expelled from the
party he was also pushed out of the pension union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. After Communist Party overtures to the leadership
of the union was any effort made to capture the rank and file?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes. There was a considerable effort made. A
person by the name of William J. Pennock, whom I have mentioned
before, who is now deceased&mdash;Pennock was a very successful figure in
this work because he was such a tireless worker.</p>

<p>(Representative Harold H. Velde left the hearing room at this
point.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. He worked day after day, every day, and had a very
pleasing personality and was a very successful man in convincing
the ordinary person that the program and policies they were pursuing
were the best for the organization. And I think it should be
recognized that certainly those efforts of the organization to maintain
a standard of decency and comfort for public assistance for the elderly
people is something which should be recognized as proper. It is
something which should not be condemned because the Communists
were trying to use that as a basis for successfully planting its other
ideas in the ranks of the organization. And I hope no one will
condemn the elderly people for trying to improve their own economic
position, which they were trying to do in the pension union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How can organizations of this type, which have a
very fine purpose in view, be able to accomplish their ends without
permitting the Communist Party to take them over and subvert them
to the purposes of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>What is the best defense? What defense can they have to the
Communist Party which is trying to manipulate them in the manner
you have described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. My own experience leads me to the conclusion that
the soundest defense and the soundest practice which can be pursued
is that wherein we all insist upon the complete observance of the
fundamental principles in the Constitution of the United States and
the legal procedure of the court system in the United States, in which
we first insist that all persons shall be considered to be innocent until
proven guilty when charged with anything which appears to be a
violation of either the Constitution of the United States or the principles
of the organization that they belong to.</p>

<p>I say that advisedly because I have had a number of experiences,
personal ones, where I have been treated as a guilty person until
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
proven so&mdash;not in connection with Communist material either. And
I observed with a great deal of interest last night’s television report
of Mr. Harry Cain’s remarks on that very point.</p>

<p>Mr. Cain comes from the State of Washington. Some of us knew
him rather well. And I might say that at one time he certainly impressed
the people very strongly in this State because of this precise
idea which he was expressing last night on TV.</p>

<p>And I cannot pass up the opportunity to remind all of us that it
is a fundamental principle of our form of Government, of our democratic
representation system, that we honor and dignify the individual
as an individual for his own worth, and not completely subordinate
this individual to the purpose of a mass and make him a faceless
creature.</p>

<p>I think that each person is entitled to the individual dignity and the
recognition of his right as an individual. And when he combines in
an organization it is for the purpose of assisting in the further development
of these human beings as creatures that are entitled to treatment
as human beings.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. What is your next question, Mr. Tavenner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Counsel is consulting the witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Counsel is calling my attention to the nature of your
question asking what steps can be recommended, and he is trying to
bring me back to that point a little more directly, and I appreciate it.
I hope you will bear with us on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Let me suggest this to you:</p>

<p>My question was not so much directed at what you mentioned as it
is to this particular phase of the matter, that here is an organization
which had very proper purposes: It apparently had no desire to be
controlled or influenced by the Communist Party; but the Communist
Party determined it was going to take it over.</p>

<p>Now my point is: How, from your experience in the party, could
this group have successfully resisted being taken over by the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>(At this point Representative Harold H. Velde returned to the
hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I think there is no one single guaranty. I think it
requires a number of changes in our behavior and in our attitude in
the various democratic organizations. I mean by that democratic in
form; I am not referring to a party as such.</p>

<p>In that respect, many people in the union to which I should belong
have asked me many times how could they guarantee that some untoward
thing would not occur in the organization. And it has been
my recommendation to them that the only guarantee anyone has is that
he participate fully in the life of his own organization and not delegate
and not allow his own responsibilities to be passed on to somebody
else.</p>

<p>If you leave it to George, let George do it, you wake up some time
and find that George hasn’t done it the way you would have preferred
to do it or the way you would have done it had you been there.</p>

<p>And it is my firm conviction that one of the most hazardous parts
of our democratic process is the tendency of people to leave it to somebody
else to take care of their own responsibility.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span></p>

<p>If a democracy is to work, if it is to be a democracy or continue to be
a democracy, it is essential that each participant, each member be a
participant. That is the best recommendation I can make.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. That is very true. In our investigations the committee
has found many instances where the Communist Party leaders
have been able to infiltrate into, say, a local union in the eastern section
of this country because the membership did not attend the elections
and did not vote and participate actively in the meetings. If
there were other means of voting than to be personally present, that
might be avoided.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I favor referendum votes myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In other words, the point you are making is: There
is a very great responsibility on each individual in his own organization
regardless of the organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I would add to that, sir, if I may, please, that it is
necessary that members do more than attend meetings. I mean they
must have some adequate conception of the purpose of their organization.</p>

<p>Just like in the conduct of the affairs of the Government of the
United States, I don’t think it is sufficient for persons to be elected
as Congressmen and then just sit there. I think they have got to know
what the Constitution of the United States provides, and I think they
have to be the guardians to make certain that everybody abides by it,
and that they abide by it themselves and insist that their own members
abide by it.</p>

<p>I think that the question of a member just being a member of an
organization and just being a card-carrying member is not sufficient.
Likewise, it is not sufficient to have representatives of government just
be present. Being present isn’t enough. They have to understand
what they are there for. And pursue their purpose of representing
their constituents.</p>

<p>I say that as a comparison because the two things are similar. There
is an identity.</p>

<p>Our greatest democratic practice occurs in the organizations which
are not directly associated with government as such.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. That applies, as you have said, to unions and organizations
social or otherwise, as well as the general election of the
United States where probably only 65 percent of the people go to the
polls and vote.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. A very simple way of expressing what you have
said is that people should be informed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. They must be informed.</p>

<p>And I am strictly opposed to secret negotiations, whether it occurs
between employers and unions, whether it occurs between heads of
organizations, or whether it occurs in international affairs. I think
that the only safeguard that we have that the rights of the people will
not be trespassed upon is when everything is out in the open.</p>

<p>I am willing to admit that until an agreement is arrived at, until
a conclusion is reached, it may be necessary to conduct the negotiations
or the conferences with a limited amount of access to public discussion.
That may be so. I am not prepared to say that everything must
be done in a goldfish bowl. But I am very insistent in my own conviction
and in my own practices, at least for the past several years,
that anything I do is going to be out in the open where the whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
world can take a look at it. If they don’t like it they can say so. And
if that is the way they feel about it, fine. I’ll step aside and retire.
But if they do approve it, let them go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. When discussing the Washington Commonwealth
Federation yesterday, did you give an estimate of 5,500 as being, in
your opinion, the total Communist Party membership in the State
of Washington or in this district?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I said at that time there were approximately 5,500
members at one time in 1 year. I think it was 1938.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Have you any knowledge or information, whether it
be in the form of an opinion or from your experience, as to the total
Communist Party membership in this area at the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. No. I have no adequate idea about that. I think
that it must be very small. Someone asked me the other day what I
thought it was, and I said, “Well, I think the ranks of the Communist
Party have been decimated by their own foolish behavior and by the
change in public attitude. I think that has resulted in them being
reduced to a mere handful, a shell of its former self.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Then you would tell us now that you have no knowledge
or information of any communistic or Communist Party activity
in Seattle at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. No. We are coming to the point of my expulsion,
which occurred 7, nearly 8 years ago. So my experience and knowledge
would have to break at that point with respect to the Communist
Party itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I presume you are familiar generally with the testimony
Barbara Hartle gave here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I listened to it very carefully.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. She brought Communist Party activities in this area
up to date as nearly as anyone possibly could in her situation.</p>

<p>Would you appraise her testimony as being true as to general matters
concerning Communist activities here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. In all fairness to her and in all fairness to the persons
that she mentioned, I would have to say that I think Barbara
Hartle was her real self when she was here. She appeared to me to
be exactly the same as the person I knew many years before. She
was very deliberate and methodical. She always had been. And I
think that she gave as accurate an account as she could possibly do. I
marvel at the ability that she displayed in doing it, the names that
she mentioned.</p>

<p>I have tried to explain to my personal friends&mdash;they have asked me
about it; how could a person name so many people as she did? I can
only say that Barbara was in a position where she had access to those
records. It was part of her duty to handle records of the membership.
Therefore, she would be required to know those things.</p>

<p>People have asked me, “Well, do you know the same people that she
knew?” And I have had to answer, “I certainly knew most of those
people.”</p>

<p>But I am not in a position where I could say that, of my own knowledge,
I knew those persons as members of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>I knew practically all of those persons in some capacity or another,
but in very few instances is it possible for me to say, of my own knowledge,
that I knew such and such a person to be a member of the Communist
Party.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span></p>

<p>And that was a very important distinction for me to make.</p>

<p>But I must say that it is my considered judgment that Barbara
Hartle gave very valid and very accurate information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I certainly thank you for that, Mr. Dennett. That was
my impression, too. Not being in a position to know as much about it
as either of you I did get the impression that she told a very valid
story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I am sure she was accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I appreciate your verification of her story as to the extent
of the Communist Party in this area.</p>

<p>Another thing I would like to get cleared up before we go further,
Mr. Counsel and Mr. Chairman, is a matter of your identification of
Harry Lundeberg as having attended fraction meetings. I think you
probably are as anxious to get that cleared up as we are. We know
that Mr. Lundeberg has been a very faithful anti-Communist for a
long time.</p>

<p>Would you like to make further comment on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I didn’t expect that that would come up, and I was
quite surprised at the furor it has created. I had no idea at the time
that I mentioned this that it was of such importance or that such importance
would be made of it.</p>

<p>I think perhaps it requires that I give you a little bit more detail
of how I had such knowledge so that you may judge for yourselves as
to the accuracy or validity of what I had to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Actually, of course, back in those days about which you
were testifying there was nothing seriously wrong in the minds of
most American people with attending fraction meetings of the Communist
Party. So I agree with you. I don’t see any reason for all
the furor. But I thought possibly you would like to clear it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I certainly would, sir. Thank you for asking me.</p>

<p>The first I heard of the furor, a friend of mine called me on the
phone last night and asked me if I had read the morning paper which
carried the story of Mr. Lundeberg’s denial. I said I had not. So he
read it to me, and he asked me what I had to say about it then. Some
of my personal friends did. And I had to remind him, just as I just
stated to you, that I had no idea it was going to have that much
importance attached to it.</p>

<p>But let me give you the facts as it occurred.</p>

<p>You will recall in my testimony I mentioned going into the Inlandboatmen’s
Union of the Pacific, what was then the Ferry Boatmen’s
Union. It was in 1936&mdash;Well, it was in 1935, the end of 1935 when the
first strike occurred against an arbitration award.</p>

<p>At that time the Maritime Federation of the Pacific had been already
organized. Mr. Lundeberg was the president of it. Their
headquarters were here in Seattle. He had an office here in a building
close to the Pioneer Square. I believe it is properly called Pioneer
Place. Mr. Lundeberg held an office there as the president of
the federation, and his first and able assistant was Mr. Ernest Fox
whom I have mentioned before.</p>

<p>When I was elected a delegate to represent the crew of the ship
that I was working on, to attend our first strike meeting, on my way
to that meeting I stopped at the office of the president of the Maritime
Federation of the Pacific, Mr. Harry Lundeberg, and asked him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
what he thought of the situation that I found myself in; namely,
elected as a delegate, representing an organization which I knew
practically nothing about. And I asked him further what advice he
would give me.</p>

<p>Mr. Lundeberg was very gracious to me, and advised me that the
“tule” sailors&mdash;by which he referred to our Sound freight-boat men
because he didn’t consider us to be genuine sailors at all because we
didn’t get outside into deep water; we were always here in the rivers
or the harbors, and he called us “tule” sailors.</p>

<p>And he said, “The first thing you have got to do is get rid of your
finky leaders.”</p>

<p>And I asked him on what basis he made such a statement.</p>

<p>And he said, “You talk to Ernie. Ernie can tell you the whole
story, and I will O. K. and vouch for it.”</p>

<p>So I asked Ernest Fox a little bit more about it. And Ernie explained
to me that the maritime leaders at that time had a great
hatred for the leaders of the then ferry boatmen’s union because those
leaders of the ferry boatmen’s union had not gone along with the
general strike plans in San Francisco in 1934. And Mr. Lundeberg
was one of the principal supporters of those strike plans at that
time.</p>

<p>As a result of Mr. Lundeberg’s attitude at that time, the Communist
Party had the utmost confidence in his integrity and in his leadership.
And Mr. Fox, Ernest Fox, informed me that Lundeberg had
attended fraction meetings, taught fraction meetings where he had
met with 1 or 2 party leaders to outline the policy and program to be
followed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. When you say “party leaders” are you referring to the
Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is right; I am referring to Communist Party
leaders.</p>

<p>But Mr. Fox also warned me at that time that he had a few misgivings
about where Mr. Lundeberg was going because Mr. Lundeberg
had already begun to show evidence that he was beginning to have
differences with the party and that he was resisting attending any
more fraction meetings at a very early date.</p>

<p>So it is quite true that Mr. Lundeberg was incensed. He didn’t like
the Communist Party.</p>

<p>I simply mention in passing, at the outset, that he had been brought
into a fraction meeting, and it was common knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. In other words, he had been brought into contact with
the Communist Party leaders as a result of the work he was performing
but not in the capacity of being a Communist himself? Is that
what you are saying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is true. Even the most ardent anti-Communist
can be drawn into Communist activities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you mean drawn into contact with Communists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>My counsel cautions me to be certain that you understand I at no
time accused Mr. Harry Lundeberg of being a Communist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I think that is a matter of record. In fact, you have
said everything favorable to Mr. Lundeberg’s record. But I suppose
it might be presumed that if you and another Communist Party leader
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
had a conference with Mr. Lundeberg some time that that would be a
meeting such as you mentioned in your testimony yesterday, or could
be considered a fraction meeting; could it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. No; that would not be regarded as a top fraction
meeting. A top fraction meeting would be only a meeting where the
leaders of an organization who were members of the Communist Party
met either with themselves or with some official of the Communist
Party. And in Mr. Lundeberg’s case&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Is that the type of meeting to which you referred when
you said that you had general knowledge, or it was common knowledge
that Mr. Lundeberg attended top fraction meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. True.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. My recollection of your testimony was that you
made it clear Mr. Lundeberg was not a member of the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I thought so; I meant to, certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You meant to, and if there is any question about
your testimony on that point I understand you now do make it clear
that you did not intend, and that you did not characterize Mr. Lundeberg
as a member of the Communist Party. Am I correct in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And your only information about his attendance at
a so-called fraction meeting was the information given to you by his
assistant, Mr. Fox?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. And I might say, for verification, that the very line
which Mr. Lundeberg had urged upon me to follow was exactly the
line which the leaders of the Communist Party gave me at that time
also; namely, attack your leaders, get rid of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. We were discussing the activity of the Communist
Party within the Old-Age Pension Union. Will you tell the committee,
please, whether you can at this time recall the names of other
persons active in that organization who were known to you to be
members of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. My own knowledge doesn’t extend beyond the top
leaders of that organization, which I have already mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That brings us to the period you described yesterday
when the Washington Commonwealth Federation was being dissolved.
My recollection is you indicated that it was dissolved at the instance of
the Communist Party. Am I correct in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. It did that during the Second World War when I
was in the military service. I only know of that from correspondence
and what I read in the newspapers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You also told us that the component parts of the
Washington Commonwealth Federation began to pull away from
that organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the reason for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The main reason was the conflicting international
policies.</p>

<p>You will recall that in that historical period there were rapid
changes taking place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am trying to return to the point where we broke
off testimony on that subject.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span></p>

<p>What became your activity in the field, in this general field upon the
weakening of the federation as a result of the change in international
problems you described yesterday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. With the rise of the CIO following the split in the
labor movement I was elected to be the secretary of the Seattle CIO
Council, and subsequently became the executive secretary of the Washington
State CIO Council.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Can you give us dates, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. In 1937 the American Federation of Labor started
expelling from its ranks those unions which had advocated the industrial
form of organization. I was in a union which did advocate the
industrial form of organization, but we were not one of those that
attracted primary interest. Therefore, they did not expel our union
right away. They never did expel it in fact. However, since we were
supporting the industrial form of organization, I advocated that our
organization be among the first to swing to the CIO. That was the
Inlandboatmen’s Union of the Pacific.</p>

<p>Subsequently, a referendum vote was held and the membership
voted overwhelmingly to withdraw from the American Federation of
Labor and affiliate with the CIO.</p>

<p>Being one of the most regular representatives of the organization
among outside affiliates, I was selected and elected by the members of
these unions to represent what was first called the Seattle Unity
Council, in 1937. In that year we had affiliated to that council both
CIO and A. F. of L. organizations and unaffiliated organizations.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, I could say that my activities there
were transferred to a larger field when I became the secretary of the
State CIO council, which was founded in 1938. And history will
confirm that the first convention of the CIO was also held that year
in Atlantic City.</p>

<p>I was a delegate to that convention, and there I came in contact
with the national leadership of the CIO unions, and with the national
leaders in the CIO unions who were known to me as Communists.</p>

<p>Do you wish me to go into that now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes, briefly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. One of the first instructions that I received in that
matter was from a man by the name of Roy Hudson who was the
national&mdash;well, he objected to being called the labor expert in the central
committee of the Communist Party. However, he usually had
the duty of following the assignments of the respective Communist
members.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Just a moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, you will probably recall that we had Roy Hudson as
a witness in our California hearings in December of 1953, but he refused
to give this committee any material information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Well, he gave me some instructions when I went to a
national convention, and his instruction to me was very brief. He
said, “Any time you need to settle a question and you are in doubt,
just see Lee Pressman.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Lee Pressman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Lee Pressman.</p>

<p>I did try to do that, but my experience with Lee Pressman was
highly unsatisfactory, and I came back to one of the district bureau
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
meetings and reported the unsatisfactory nature of my relations
with him, and the district organizer instructed me to destroy the
report which I had brought back.</p>

<p>I had brought back a somewhat detailed report of my unsatisfactory
experiences with him, and the bureau listened with considerable
astonishment at my impressions of how unsatisfactory this situation
was. That was from the first convention. And after that, after they
had instructed me to destroy the records, they also instructed me to
not talk about it with anyone because they feared it might undermine
the prestige of such an important person as Mr. Lee Pressman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. During what period of time did you know Mr. Pressman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That was in 1938.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. At that time he was in the CIO. He had left the Government,
as I understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. He was the general counsel of the CIO, and was
John L. Lewis’ righthand man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I do not recall the date of Mr. Pressman’s testimony.
Was it in 1949?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes; in 1949 or early 1950 we had him as a witness
before our committee and interrogated him on his connection with the
CIO at that particular time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did you know Lee Pressman as a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I didn’t know that personally. I was just under the
instruction&mdash;I asked Roy Hudson who I should see in the event I got
crossed up and didn’t know what policy to pursue or anything, and he
said, “See Lee Pressman. Do what he says.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, this is a matter which we should
follow through. But, not knowing the character of the experience
this witness had with Mr. Pressman, I believe it is a matter we should
investigate fully before attempting to further examine the witness on
the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you have documentary evidence of any character
on that incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I can’t be sure whether I have or not. I don’t
recall all the things that I have in my files.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Proceed, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Well, I came in contact with many other leaders in
the national CIO. I used to have the habit of attending the national
CIO executive board meetings whenever the convention was over.
There had been an election of new officials at the close of the convention,
and I was usually there in company with the president of the
Inlandboatmen’s Union of the Pacific, who became a member of the
executive board. And he usually asked me to come along with him.</p>

<p>And it has always been my habit to take rather copious notes. As
a matter of fact, most people screamed to high heaven because the
notes I take are a little bit too full and too elaborate. I do that for
my own benefit because I try not to rely solely on memory. I have
found it very profitable in my own experience to have my full memoranda
at hand when I am called upon to testify.</p>

<p>And in this testimony here I am testifying almost completely from
memory, but I assure you that I have plenty of memoranda and data
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
which cannot only substantiate what I have been testifying, but enrich
it very, very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What further information can you give us as to the
Communist Party membership of individuals in this new field in which
you were engaged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Well, of course, one of our principal centers of interest
was the International Woodworkers of America. And there, of course,
it became my responsibility to become well acquainted with the top
leadership in the International Woodworkers of America. And I
think that many people have made the accusation but probably few
people know of their own knowledge such as I do, that practically all
of the top leaders were, with a few exceptions, members of the Communist
Party. And that began with Mr. Harold J. Pritchett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you spell the last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. P-r-i-t-c-h-e-t-t.</p>

<p>Mr. Harold Pritchett was a very able and outstanding man from the
lumber industry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was his official title?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. He was the president.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What is the period or the date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. 1938.</p>

<p>He was a Canadian and was barred from reentry into the United
States shortly afterward, and has been unable&mdash;he was at that time
unable to continue his functions as president, and had to give up the
office of president.</p>

<p>We were quite disappointed that that occurred. We tried every
way we knew to insure that he could continue to serve in that capacity.
However, we had to be satisfied with allowing another member who
was a vice president to take his position. This was Mr. O. M. Orton,
O-r-t-o-n, better known to us as Mickey Orton. He was the vice president
who took over when Mr. Pritchett had to give up the office.</p>

<p>The office staff&mdash;I mean the girls who worked in the office were
virtually cleared by the Communist Party before they secured their
employment in the office. The girl who was in charge at that office&mdash;the
name I knew her by&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You said virtually cleared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Does that mean that the worker you have in mind
must have been a member of the Communist Party? In other words,
we do not want you to give us the name of a person unless you have
evidence of actual Communist Party membership.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I will not name anyone unless that person was a
member of the Communist Party, according to my knowledge. Well,
the girl who was looked upon as the office manager&mdash;I don’t recall the
exact title she had&mdash;but her name was Gladys Field, F-i-e-l-d. And
all the stenographers and bookkeepers who were employed by the
organization had to meet her approval before they could be employed
in that office. And her approval was based upon whether or not the
person would be friendly or hostile to the Communist Party, as well
as being, of course, efficient and able to do the job. She was an exceedingly
efficient girl herself, and did a splendid job as an office
manager. She would be a credit to any office so far as her office work
is concerned, and she was a credit to that organization. She had as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
one of her able assistants a girl by the name of Helen Sobeleski. I am
not sure that I can spell that. It is a Polish name.</p>

<p>Well along in that period Mr. Karley Larsen came into prominence
in the Woodworkers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. To what union does this testimony relate concerning
officials and employees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The International Woodworkers of America.</p>

<p>Another person I knew was Nat Honig, H-o-n-i-g.</p>

<p>Nat Honig was brought into the district by Morris Rappaport
to become an agitprop director. I knew Mr. Honig quite well, and
I sympathized with the task that he had. He didn’t last very long
in that either. He soon found himself as editor of the Woodworkers’
paper, the International Woodworkers of America’s paper. And I
had occasion to attempt to get him to carry out the party line, and I
was amazed to find a man who was officially holding a position of
district agitprop director while he was editor of that paper, and yet,
when the May Day issue of that paper came out there wasn’t one single
mention of the fact that May Day was the historical day to be commemorated
for the 8-hour day in America and was heralded throughout
the world as laborers’ day.</p>

<p>Mr. Honig explained it away, that he didn’t think it was appropriate
to do it.</p>

<p>I went to Mr. Rappaport complaining, “What kind of a district
agitprop is this man anyway?”</p>

<p>And Rappaport had quite a session with Honig, and shortly after
that Mr. Honig began to have some disaffection from the party and the
party policy, and I believe he appeared before the Canwell committee
shortly afterward and gave voluminous testimony about the Communist
Party. I have not read his testimony. I do not know how valid
it is. I couldn’t confirm or deny what he said. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. What was the approximate time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That was in that period 1939, I believe; 1939 or 1940
when that happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Can you recall any other individuals connected with
the International Woodworkers of America who were members of the
Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I have a little difficulty thinking of any others at the
moment in that particular union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The committee had before it at Albany, N. Y., in
July 1953, a Canadian by the name of Patrick Walsh who was connected
with that organization in the western part of Canada during
one period of time and who later became very prominent in the Canadian
seamen’s union strike in 1949.</p>

<p>Did you become acquainted with Patrick Walsh?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. No; I never knew him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The committee will stand recessed for 5 minutes.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, a short recess was taken.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The committee will be in order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Dennett, you were giving us the names of persons
known to you to be members of the Communist Party within the
field of labor at the time that you were a member of the CIO council.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you proceed, please?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Well, of course, I think I mentioned Mr. Hugh
DeLacy before. He was from the teachers union. And, of course,
there was one of his associates, a man by the name of Harold Eby.
They were the only ones that I knew directly in the Communist Party,
in the teachers union, from the university.</p>

<p>There was another person by the name of Victor Hicks who was
quite well known to me who was in the other teachers union. There
were two teachers’ unions, locals here. One applied to the public
schools, and one applied to the university. Victor Hicks was in the
one that applied to the public schools, although I don’t believe he was a
public-school teacher himself. But he had taught in one of those Government
assistance programs. I forget which one it was. There was
some kind of an educational program that was conducted in the depression
days that Mr. Hicks was associated with, and he was the
principal one. In fact, he was responsible for nominating me to
the position of secretary of the council in the first CIO council in
Seattle.</p>

<p>Of course, I knew Mr. Jess Fletcher in the Building Service Employees
International Union, which was an A. F. of L. union, not one
of the CIO unions.</p>

<p>In the Longshoremen’s Union<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> I knew Mr. Burt Nelson, B-u-r-t
N-e-l-s-o-n.</p>

<p>I knew these people as members of the Communist Party, and they
were the leaders with whom I dealt most frequently in dealing with
union affairs and with party affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. When naming a person, if possible, identify him in
some way so he will not be confused with any person who may have
a similar name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Burt was a longshoreman. He worked as a longshoreman
on the Seattle waterfront.</p>

<p>George Bailey was a longshoreman known to me first in Raymond,
Wash. Later I knew him on the Seattle waterfront.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How does he spell his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I believe it was B-a-i-l-e-y.</p>

<p>In the early days of the organization of the warehousemen’s local
of the International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union the
two principal officers of the organization were very well known to
me as members of the Communist Party. However, they frequently
did not comply with the party policy, and we had frequent difficulty
trying to get them to comply with it. And I believe that they have both
since left the Communist Party. I make that by way of statement to
be certain that there is no misapprehension as to my knowledge about
them. One was Mr. John Stevens, better known as Johnny. Another
one was Adrian Lawrence, A-d-r-i-a-n L-a-w-r-e-n-c-e.</p>

<p>In the Marine Firemen’s Union,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> which was not in the CIO, but it
was a waterfront union with which I was closely associated, was Mr.
Walter Stack, S-t-a-c-k, who has previously been mentioned, and a
person by the name of George Flood. Now I hope no one will mistake
him for another individual who is very prominent as a lawyer. I am
not speaking of the lawyer. It is not the lawyer at all, because he is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
a well known leader of the Republican Party, and I am sure that no
one will confuse him.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. My counsel advises me that that George Flood is
deceased. I was unaware of it.</p>

<p>The George Flood of whom I am speaking was a sort of hunchback
fellow who was a marine fireman.</p>

<p>At an earlier period I knew a group of people in the Boeing union,
the machinists union, who were known to me as members of the
Communist Party. That came about when one of the organizers of
the United Automobile Workers of America came into Seattle wanting
to swing the affiliation from the machinists union to the United Automobile
Workers. That national leader was a man by the name of
Wyndham Mortimer, W-y-n-d-h-a-m M-o-r-t-i-m-e-r. He was an
organizer. At that time he was stationed in California. He was
quite anxious to bring about the change in affiliation of the Boeing
workers because he knew that the employment at that plant would
increase, and had hoped that, by winning that group of workers, they
would add considerable prestige and strength to the United Automobile
Workers aircraft division. He had been active in a big plant.
I think it was the Lockheed plant in California at that time.</p>

<p>When he came here he conferred with two persons known to me very
well, a man by the name of Hugo Lundquist, L-u-n-d-q-u-i-s-t, and
Barney Bader, B-a-d-e-r. They were at that time the top leaders of
the aeronautical workers union, and they became known to me through
Mr. Mortimer as members of the Communist Party. And they completely
disregarded my counsel which was that they were embarked
on a foolhardy effort and that we disagreed with any attempt at
jurisdictional rating. Our policy here was strictly opposed to it.</p>

<p>However, Mortimer was operating under authority of the top apparatus
of the party, namely, the central committee in New York City.
And he completely disregarded any advice or counsel which was
offered by the district bureau or the district leaders of the Communist
Party in this area.</p>

<p>It was our policy to not disturb the existing unions to change affiliation.
To us that was ridiculous and had no point of value. Our
concern was to not have our members upset or disturbed in those
organizations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It may be of importance for us to know the year in
which this incident occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I would have to consult my records, but I can assure
you I have records on that. I have extensive correspondence with Mr.
Mortimer on that subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That will be satisfactory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Is the Walter Stack, to whom you referred, the same
Walter Stack who was convicted of violation of the Smith Act?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bennett</span>. I don’t know what his violation is, but I am sure he is
the man who was very prominent in the marine firemen’s union over a
great many years. He came from here when I knew him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I feel certain that it is one and the same person. I
noted in the newspaper the other day that his appeal was turned
down by the United States circuit court of appeals.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. In the national conventions of the CIO, after my
first experience, which was highly unsatisfactory, with Mr. Lee Pressman,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
I complained so bitterly when I came back to the district that
the next convention I went to I was instructed before I left that I
should work through Reid Robinson, who was president of the International
Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers of America at
that time. Mr. Robinson proved to be a very cooperative man and
readily discussed party affairs with me. That was in 1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You say you were given instructions to work
through Robinson. Was that an instruction from your union as such,
or was it an instruction from the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That was from the Communist Party.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. My counsel thinks that I have not sufficiently identified
Mr. Lee Pressman. He was at the time I knew him general
counsel of the CIO.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you proceed, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. My relations with Mr. Reid Robinson were quite
satisfactory except that at a little bit later date, when I was under
sharp attack because of the growing split between left and right
wings in the State CIO in this State, I tried to get Mr. Reid Robinson
to come to this State to try to pacify the situation, and he was fearful
of doing so for fear he would get into more complications than he
could solve. So he deserted me when I needed help.</p>

<p>Earlier, of course, I knew Ferdinand Smith from the National
Maritime Union of America. I believe he has been deported from
the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. It is the same person. I had known him over a
period of several years.</p>

<p>I also came to know the president of the officeworkers union at that
time. That was the United Office and Professional Workers of America,
Mr. Lewis Merrill. He was known to me by that name then. I
have heard from friends since then that that was an assumed name
or something. At any rate, he is doing business in New York City
under an entirely different name as of this date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you know that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I do not know that name. I know a person who
does, who lives in the city of Seattle, and who knows him. But I do
not know him myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How do you spell his name, the name that he went
by here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. L-e-w-i-s M-e-r-r-i-l-l.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you proceed, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. At a much earlier period&mdash;I am going back to try
to pick up the loose threads that we left out when we should have mentioned
them, but I was unable to connect all my thoughts consecutively
at that time. In the organization of the Marine Workers Industrial
Union Mr. Harry Jackson, whom I mentioned to you, was
the chief leader of that effort here. But he had 2 or 3 very able assistants,
one by the name of James Archer, A-r-c-h-e-r. Archer is the
man to whom I delivered about $35 which was taken up as a collection
when I was in the CCC camp when I came to Seattle on a visit from
the camp. It was a collection from the men in the camp to assist the
maritime strikers at that time, and Mr. Archer is the man to whom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
I delivered that money in the headquarters of the Marine Workers
Industrial Union.</p>

<p>Another person who was very active in that work was a person by
the name of Tommy Ray, R-a-y. Later I met Tommy Ray after I
was expelled from the Communist Party. Tommy Ray at that time
was a port agent for the National Maritime Union. And I tried to
discuss with him the question of the disciplinary practices of the Communist
Party, and Ray was so incensed about his own experience
that he wouldn’t discuss it with me except to say, “Don’t talk to me
about those so-and-sos. I don’t want to have anything further to do
with them.” And that is about all I was able to obtain from him.
But it was the same person, and I believe he is still an active person
in the National Maritime Union. But he is bitterly anti-Communist
today.</p>

<p>There was another person by the name of Tom Burns. I don’t know
how we can make a distinction for him, because there are so many
persons by that name except to say that he was a seaman. I learned
later from Tommy Ray that Tom Burns became a licensed man, left
the Communist Party long before, and has had nothing to do with
it; that is, in recent years. Although he was a very able man way
back in the period of 1932, 1933, and 1934 when he was very active
in the organization of the Marine Workers Industrial Union, and had
a great part in organizing the sailors on the waterfront in Seattle at
that time.</p>

<p>I knew Tommy Burns’ wife quite well, a person by the name of&mdash;I
knew her originally as Helmi Hutenen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Spell it, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I cannot be certain of the spelling of it, but, as near
as I recall, it was H-u-t-e-n-e-n. There was double spelling in there
that I am not certain of. Helmi was H-e-l-m-i.</p>

<p>There was a leader of the radio operators, marine radio operators,
by the name of Thomas J. Van Erman. I observed in Mrs. Hartle’s
testimony that she referred to a Mr. Van Orman. I am not referring
to any Van Orman. I don’t know any Van Orman. The man I know
was Van Erman, V-a-n E-r-m-a-n. And Mr. Van Erman that I knew
worked on the Seattle waterfront as a radio operator and was, I believe
he was the port agent of that organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Let the record show in describing these persons
you knew and met, that you knew them as members of the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>I frequently made myself quite obnoxious to Mr. Van Erman
because I was always asking him to be a little more militant and
a little more positive in his work. And he was quite insistent that
I was wrong, and we had a continuing friction over that point. However,
we were great personal friends.</p>

<p>The Cannery Workers Union was a local affiliate of the United
Cannery, Agricultural, and Packinghouse Workers of America. In
the national leadership I knew a Mr. Donald Henderson, who was
the president of that organization. I knew him very well, associated
with him frequently at the convention, transacted a great deal of
business with him concerning the cannery workers out here because
we were having a great deal of difficulty over language problems.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
The cannery workers in that union were those who were sent to Alaska
regularly each year to work in the salmon industry.</p>

<p>And in the local area I knew Mr. Conrad Espe. Mr. Con Espe was
the local representative of that international union.</p>

<p>There was a member of that union who was the most promising
Communist that we had, by the name of I. Hosue, H-o-s-u-e. He was
a very able man. I have heard since from people who are somewhat
acquainted with the facts that Mr. Hosue went into the military
service, became an officer during the course of the war, and turned
bitterly anti-Communist. And I understand that he gave testimony
against certain other members of the organization in certain deportation
hearings. I can only give you that much by way of identification.
But that is the man I am speaking of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. May I suggest, Mr. Chairman, if the witness recalls
any other names, that he give them to us at a later period, as we desire
to proceed now with other witnesses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I want to recall this witness a little later in the
day on other matters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. At what time do you want Mr. Dennett back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I believe that he should be back after lunch. I
would say at 2 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Two o’clock.</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Dennett. At 2 o’clock you will be recalled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Mr. Paul Delaney, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you
are about to give before this committee will be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. I do.</p>

<h3 id="Paul_William_Delaney438">TESTIMONY OF PAUL WILLIAM DELANEY, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS
COUNSEL, RICHARD L. GEMSON</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Will the witness state his full name, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. Paul William Delaney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Will you spell the last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. D-e-l-a-n-e-y.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. When and where were you born, Mr. Delaney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. May I ask, Mr. Delaney, are you represented by
counsel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Will counsel identify himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gemson</span>. R. L. Gemson. I am a practicing attorney here in
Seattle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Proceed, Mr. Wheeler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. When and where were you born, Mr. Delaney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. I was born in 1903 in the State of Minnesota.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. How long have you lived in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. 51 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Advise the committee of your educational background,
please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. I went to school in this State: through grammar
school and high school; I attended the University of Washington 2
years. I didn’t graduate.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. What 2 years was that?</p>

<p>Mr: <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. I think in the years 1923 and 1927.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. What is your present occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. I am an architect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. How long have you been so engaged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. Well, I grew up in the construction business. I have
been a licensed architect since 1950 or 1951. I can’t state accurately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. How were you employed prior to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. I came to Seattle in 1941. I worked at Sims Drake
Puget Sound. It was a contracting firm here. I worked with a construction
company after that who built defense housing. After that
I worked, the last year of the war&mdash;in my recollection&mdash;at Boeing Aircraft
Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. When did your employment terminate with Boeing
Aircraft?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. When the war was over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. In 1945?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Have you completed your employment background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. Do you want me to bring it up to date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. As soon as the war was over I went to work as an
architectural draftsman. I went then with an architect by the name
of Collins. I think he left in 1950 or 1951, and I have been alone
since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Did you ever know Barbara Hartle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. May I confer with my attorney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Yes, sir?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. On the advice of my counsel, I must invoke the fifth
amendment, on the grounds that it might tend to incriminate me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. As previously explained by the committee because
your counsel advises you to take or invoke the fifth amendment that
does not compel you to do so. If you prefer, you may state that you
decline to answer the question on the grounds of the fifth amendment.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. Yes; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Mrs. Hartle has advised the committee that you were
a functionary of the Queen Anne section of the Communist Party during
the years 1943-45. Is she correct in that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. May I again confer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. For reasons previously given, I decline to answer this
question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Our investigation has also developed information
that you were chairman of the Hilltop Club of the Communist Party
in the year 1948. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. What was the name of the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Hilltop, H-i-l-l-t-o-p.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. Pardon me one moment.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously
stated.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Our investigation has also developed that in the
year 1943 you were issued Communist Party book No. 28704. I doubt,
if you recall the number of the book, but were you issued a Communist
Party book in the year 1943 by the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. I decline to answer for the reasons previously given.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. In the year 1945 were you issued Communist Party
book No. 42131.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. I also decline to answer that for the reasons previously
given.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. In the year 1947 were you issued Communist Party
book No. 55934 by the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. I decline to answer for the same reasons previously
given.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Are you a member of the Communist Party today,
Mr. Delaney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. I must&mdash;I decline to answer that for the reasons
previously given.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Mr. Velde?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. I must&mdash;I mean I decline to answer that.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. For the reasons previously stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Mr. Delaney, we have heard many arguments against
persons coming before congressional investigative committees and making
accusations or statements concerning other people, and that those
people do not have the opportunity to clear themselves or make explanation
of the charges made against them, such as Mrs. Hartle has
testified concerning you and your activities.</p>

<p>This committee has very carefully in each instance given the person
so mentioned an opportunity to come before the committee to deny,
affirm, or explain the charges made. And that opportunity is being
presented to you today by a subpena issued upon you for your appearance
here.</p>

<p>In reply to the questions propounded to you, I understand you decline
to answer because of the protection afforded you under the fifth
amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you wish to make any explanation, or to deny or
affirm any of these statements or charges which were made by Mrs.
Hartle concerning your communistic activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. May I confer with my counsel?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delaney</span>. My counsel instructs me to state that I decline to
answer that question on the grounds of the fifth amendment&mdash;on the
ground that it might tend to incriminate me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The witness is excused.</p>

<p>(Whereupon the witness was excused.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Counsel, proceed with the next witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Mr. Jacob Bitterman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Will you hold up your right hand and be sworn?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span></p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you are about to
give before this congressional committee will be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacDonald</span>. Kenneth A. MacDonald, attorney at law, in
Seattle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. When and where were you born, Mr. Bitterman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. I was born in Russia in 1904.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. When did you enter the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. To the best of my knowledge, in 1906.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. How did you acquire American citizenship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. Through my father’s papers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. When you became 21 years of age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. I was 12 when he became a citizen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. How long have you lived in Seattle or in the vicinity
of Seattle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. I came to Seattle in 1923.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Have you lived here continuously since that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. With the exception of 2 years, 1928 and 1929.
That is, in the fall of 1928 to the fall of 1930 I lived in Aberdeen,
Wash.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. What is your educational background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. Well, I went to the third grade in country school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. What has your employment record been for the last
10 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. Machinist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. In Seattle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. Yes. I have been a machinist ever since I have
been in Seattle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Are you a member of the International Association
of Machinists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. Yes. I am a member of local 79.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Have you held any offices in local 79?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. No, I haven’t.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. During the time you lived in Seattle did you ever
meet with, know, or have any conversations with Barbara Hartle?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. I will invoke the fifth amendment because it might
incriminate me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you decline to answer that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. I decline to answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you decline on the grounds and on the reasons of
the protection afforded to you by the provisions of the fifth amendment?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. I would like to refer to a document entitled “Investigation
of Communist Activities in the Pacific Northwest, Part 3,” page
6173. It is the testimony of Barbara Hartle in June 1954. She is
identifying members of the Communist Party, and I quote the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Jack Bitterman, then husband of Ruth Bitterman, was a member of this
section in the machinists’ branch, and was for a time chairman of that branch.</p></blockquote>

<p>Do you wish to make any comment on that testimony?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. I invoke the fifth amendment, on the same grounds
previously stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Mr. Wheeler is not asking you to confirm or deny it,
but asked merely if you wanted to make some comment on it. Why
do you take the fifth amendment on that question?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. I decline to answer that question on the same
grounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Were you chairman of the machinists’ branch of the
Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. I decline to answer that question on the same
grounds previously stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Mr. Chairman, I see no reason for asking further
questions. The witness is invoking the fifth amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Mr. Velde?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I have no questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Are you now a member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Have you ever been a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. I will again invoke the fifth amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. You say you are not now a member of the Communist
Party. Were you a member of the Communist Party a year ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. I will again invoke the fifth amendment for fear
it might incriminate me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Were you a member of the Communist Party a month
ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. I will again invoke the fifth amendment on the
grounds previously stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Would you say a week ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. I will again invoke the fifth amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. How about yesterday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. The same answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. But you are not a member today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. I am not a member today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The witness is excused.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I would like to go a little further. Were you a member
of the Communist Party an hour ago?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. No, I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Were you a member of the Communist Party 5 hours
ago?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. When did you leave the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. As to that I invoke the fifth amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Were you a member of the Communist Party at midnight
last night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. No, I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. How about 11 o’clock last night?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bitterman</span>. I will invoke the fifth amendment to that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I think that is close enough, is it not, Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The witness is excused.</p>

<p>(Whereupon the witness was excused.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Counsel, call the next witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Mr. John Stenhouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Will you raise your right hand and be sworn?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you are about to
give before this congressional subcommittee will be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I do.</p>

<h3 id="John_Stenhouse443">TESTIMONY OF JOHN STENHOUSE, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL,
JACK R. CLUCK</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you state your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. John Stenhouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It is noted you are accompanied by counsel.
Will counsel identify himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cluck</span>. Jack R. Cluck, C-l-u-c-k, 535 Central Building, Seattle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. When and where were you born, Mr. Stenhouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I was born in Chungking, China, on January 22,
1908.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you spell your last name, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. S-t-e-n-h-o-u-s-e.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Are you now an American citizen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. When and where were you naturalized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I was naturalized in Los Angeles on April 23,
1943.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. When did you arrive in the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I am not quite certain, but it was either December
of 1940 or January of 1941.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Have you been in the United States continuously
since that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No. In June 1948 I went out to China, and returned
to the United States either September or October of the same
year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you tell the committee, please, what your
formal educational training has been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, I went to a public school in England, and
after completing my education in England I went back to China.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. When did you go back to China?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. In 1928.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Where did you live in China from 1928 until you
came to the United States?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, I was in my father’s business in China. The
name of the firm was MacKenzie &amp; Co., and they had several branches
in China. I spent some time in Shanghai. I then went to&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you fix the dates, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. It is pretty hard. But approximately 9 months
in Shanghai. That would be in 1928.</p>

<p>I really don’t remember the month that I got to Shanghai, but I
was there approximately 9 months.</p>

<p>Then I went to Tientsin, and I was there until the beginning of
1931, I think it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. What kind of a company was MacKenzie &amp; Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, it was a British trading firm. We had&mdash;-</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Import-export?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. And warehouses and shipping and that sort of
activity. Then I went to Hankow. I was there until about 1934.
I remember the date because we went home on leave at that time, and
I got married that year. And then after leave I went back to Tientsin,
and I was there until 1939 when we went home on leave again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you mean to your home in England?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes. Then I went back to China in the fall of
1939, just after war was declared, and I was in Tientsin until the end
of&mdash;well, the end of 1940. During 1940 I was sent up on a mission by
my company to Chungking and to Hong Kong. That lasted about 3 or
4 months, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. After your arrival in this country how did you
become employed and where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, before I left China I had made arrangements
with a firm in Peiping to import and sell Chinese antiques. And he
gave me the name of a man in Los Angeles with whom he had done
business, and suggested that I call on him because he was in somewhat
similar business. And when I got to Los Angeles I called on
this gentleman and made arrangements to work out of his establishment.</p>

<p>Later on&mdash;I can’t remember the date&mdash;I went into partnership with
him under the style of Alkow &amp; Stenhouse, and we conducted an
importing business of Chinese antiques and sort of handicraft items,
and had a retail outlet on Wilshire Boulevard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How long were you so engaged in business in Los
Angeles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Until Pearl Harbor. And I decided then that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. From what date until Pearl Harbor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, as soon as I got to Los Angeles, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That date was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I don’t remember the exact date, but it was sometime
in January of 1941.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That is sufficient.</p>

<p>Will you proceed, please. You continued in that business until
Pearl Harbor. How were you employed after Pearl Harbor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor
the war was on. And, for one thing, I wanted to participate in the
war. So I took a drafting course and then got a job with Shell
Chemical in Dominguez, I think it was until the end of&mdash;I was there
for 3 or 4 months, I think it was. I don’t remember the exact date
now.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. What was the name of the company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Shell Chemical.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Is that also known as Shell Development Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I don’t know. It may be a subsidiary. It was
connected with the Shell Oil Co.</p>

<p>Then I got a job with Fruehauf Trailer Co., which was nearer
home. And I was there until, I think, about June of 1943.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you proceed a little more rapidly? What was
your next employment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Then I went to Bendix Aviation in North Hollywood.
The reason for the change was, or one of the reasons for the
change was, it was much nearer home, and gasoline was a problem.
Time and transportation time were problems. And I was at Bendix
until about March 1945, when I had a hernia operation and was told
to get out of that sort of work.</p>

<p>At about that time there were notices in the papers asking for people
with some background in the Far East to assist in finishing off the war
against Japan. So I applied for a number of jobs. One was with
the Office of War Information, and another was with the Office of
Strategic Services. I also applied for work with 2 or 3 American
companies who were planning or had had affiliations in the Far East.</p>

<p>And then I got an appointment with the United States Department
of Commerce as an economic analyst in the China Section of the Far
Eastern Division.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Is that the first position you held under the United
States Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And when did you enter the employ of the United
States Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I think it was June 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did your duties require you to go to Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How long did you remain in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, I remained with the Government until November
1947, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Is that with the Commerce Department until 1947?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Were you an economic analyst in the Far Eastern
Division during your entire employment by the Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No. About a year after I was there I was promoted
to Chief of the China Section and, some time in there, as
Acting Assistant Chief of the Division. And a little later, just before
I left the Department, I was temporary Acting Chief of the Division
while the Division Chief was away.</p>

<p>In 1947, November 1947, my employment there terminated, and
again I was looking for a suitable occupation. And I applied many,
many places. I applied with many American firms who were in
business in the Far East or had business connections in the Far East.
And I also applied for an appointment that I heard about with the
United Nations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you receive the appointment with the United
Nations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. When?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I think it was about June of 1948. There was a
period when I was living in Washington that I was not employed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the nature of your employment by the
United Nations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I had a 3-month special appointment to go out to
Shanghai to work on the Economic Commission for Asia and the
Far East, which was a separate section of the United Nations. And
the work was related to the rehabilitation of trade, with special reference
to the development of interregional trade in the light of the
changed situation after the war.</p>

<p>I wrote a report which was included in a document published by
the United Nations.</p>

<p>At the end of the 3-month period I was appointed administrative
assistant to the&mdash;I don’t know what his actual title was, but it was
something like director of food and agriculture mission in China;
a 3-month appointment again, and I worked in that capacity for
about 3 months; I think until the end of September, when I was found
to have some possibilities of tuberculosis. So I wanted to go back to
the United States and get a thorough investigation of that, and I got
a letter from the director of the mission there to the home office
suggesting that I be given a permanent contract&mdash;not a permanent
contract but a more long-range contract to go out under circumstances
that would allow me to take my family out. However, on the way
back from China I stopped here in Seattle and met some businessmen
for whom I had done some work in my official capacity in the Department.
They were pleased with the work I had done and they suggested
that I join their firm in Seattle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the approximate date of your return to
the United States when you first became a resident of this community?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, my return to the United States was about
September or October of 1948. I went back to Washington&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I understand that. But you told us about your
return to the United States and stopping here in Seattle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. You asked me when I first came here, and became
a resident. There was a gap of a couple of months because I went
back to Washington to pick up my family, and we actually came here
to Seattle as residents in January of 1949.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Have you resided in Seattle since that date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What is your present occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I am an insurance agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Have you read any of the testimony before this
committee of General Willoughby who was G-2 on General MacArthur’s
staff, which related to the development of communism in
China?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. General Willoughby documented considerable evidence
before this committee regarding the activities of certain American
citizens in China. My desire now is merely to ask you whether
or not you observed any Communist Party activities on the part of
American nationals in China?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And I refer particularly to the period 1928 and 1929
when you were in Shanghai.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I didn’t know anything about it. I was a businessman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Have you at any time been affiliated with the Communist
Party, and, if so, in what country or countries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. During the war some 10 years ago I was a member
of the Communist Party in this country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In this country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. And that is the only affiliation that I have had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am not asking you now about your own affiliation,
or indicating that I believe you were affiliated with the Communist
Party in China, but we are anxious to have any information you have
regarding Communist Party activities in China.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I haven’t any information, Mr. Tavenner. When
I left China in 1940 I only had a very vague idea about what was
going on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Let me put the question to you this way because it
is a very broad subject.</p>

<p>General Willoughby testified before this committee that the form
of organization of mass organizations in China from 1929 on was
virtually identical with what we have found in this country since the
early and middle thirties, that is, in working through mass organizations
or front organizations, as we frequently call them in this country.</p>

<p>Did you observe any activity of that kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No, and I wouldn’t have done it because I was living
in the international concessions in watertight compartments where
we associated, except in business, with Europeans and Americans. I
am somewhat&mdash;what was going on in the interior of China and in Chinese
politics I was somewhat abysmally ignorant of in those days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It has been demonstrated that Americans, people
from this country took an active part in some of that organizational
work in China.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did the fact that you were in an international section
mean that you could not have had any knowledge of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, I didn’t have any knowledge of it. I was
involved in business until the Japanese threatened my business. I
wasn’t concerned with politics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am not indicating I have any information that
you were involved in it. I am merely asking what knowledge you had
of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I really have no knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I think we ought to make this clear: Are you referring
to the period of time you were in China prior to 1940, and not about
your trip the second time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Have you been back more than once since 1940 to
China?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No. Only once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you say you became a member of the Communist
Party while you were in Los Angeles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the approximate date of your becoming
a member?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, to the best of my recollection, it was in the
latter part of 1943.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Where were you living at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. In Horseshoe Canyon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you assigned to any particular group of the
Communist Party when you first became a member?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I don’t think it was a matter of assignment, to
my knowledge. I was asked if I would like to attend some discussion
group meetings and, to the best of my recollection, there were not more
than 4 or 5 of them in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Four or 5 what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Of these discussion group meetings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you mean that you attended 4 or 5 of these discussion
group meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you recall whether or not you were transferred
from one such group to another?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I am pretty certain I wasn’t. I am not aware of
it. Somebody may have transferred me. But, as far as I know, I
attended a group of discussion meetings somewhere, not too far from
where we lived in North Hollywood. I don’t remember now whether
it was in more than one home. It may have been in 1 or 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How many persons attended those meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. About 4 or 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were they always the same persons or did the group
vary as to its composition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. It may have varied. I don’t remember for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the nature of the business conducted at
those meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, we discussed Communist and other literature
and articles. We discussed the affairs that were concerning all
of us at that time, of the war and the winning of the war&mdash;and it was
just talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you recall whether or not Communist Party
literature was made available for your purchase at the meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And for your use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you take part in the study group, in the study
of the Communist Party literature yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Oh, I suppose I read what we were asked to read
or was suggested we read, and made some attempt to discuss it at the
next meeting.</p>

<p>I might add that the literature that was at those meetings was also
on sale in some of the bookstores in Los Angeles. There was a Lincoln
Book Store there which had Communist and other material for sale.
I was in the bookstore 2 or 3 times. There was also at these meetings
material that was not Communist, at least not published by the party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was the Lincoln Book Store known as a Communist
book shop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. It wasn’t known to me as such.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. There has been evidence of that character presented
to the committee.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, I wouldn’t doubt it actually. But they sold
things other than Communist Party literature. And it wasn’t under
the table. It was right out in the open. Anybody from the street
could walk in and pick it up and read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Who invited you to become a member of that group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I don’t know, sir. At that time I was very active
in the United Auto Workers. I felt that the United Auto Workers
was doing a fine job in increasing production for the war. Their no-strike
pledge was very loyally kept, and there were people there who
always attended meetings, who were always ready to try and get other
people to come to the union meetings, who were ready to do jobs for
the union in the way of promoting blood-bank drives, and so on, getting
people to register to vote, and the sort of things that I was
interested in. Some one of these people who I had some knowledge of
their actions asked me if I would go to such a meeting, and I said I
would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were the other members of this group of Communist
Party persons employed in the same business in which you were employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, as far as I remember, there were possibly
2 or 3 of the group who were at the Bendix plant. I am not sure
now. It is hard to differentiate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. You say you were interested in the same things that
they were interested in, that is, getting people interested in elections
and going to the polls to vote.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you recall whether or not at that time the Communist
Party had candidates for whom you could cast a ballot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. We weren’t interested in it. We were voting
Democratic. I was a Democrat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The point I was trying to make, if you were interested
in that party why did you join the Democratic Party? I don’t
understand why you affiliated yourself with a party that had no
candidates for whom you could vote.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I didn’t deliberately go out to affiliate myself with
it. Somebody who was interested in it also, as a Democrat&mdash;and these
things that were part of the war effort&mdash;suggested that I go to one of
these meetings. And he had become a person I had some respect for
because of his apparent adherence to the things that the majority of
the American people were doing at that time. I accepted the idea
and went to the meetings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Were they Communist Party organization meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I don’t understand you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Are you talking about Communist Party meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No. I am talking about union meetings and how
it came about that somebody invited me to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. I am referring to the Communist Party meetings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. There were many meetings at that time, Mr.
Chairman&mdash;union meetings; many union meetings I attended. I was
very much impressed with the union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Were the union meetings you attended Communist
Party meetings?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I think we have got at cross purposes someway
here.</p>

<p>I was trying to explain how it came about that somebody invited me
to go to one of these discussion group meetings, and it was through
the association with somebody whom I had some regard for in his
union activity that I accepted an invitation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Was the discussion group meeting a Communist
Party meeting or merely affiliated with the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I am as confused as you are about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you know whether you were a Communist at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, to be frank about it, I believe I signed a
Communist Party card at some time.</p>

<p>I have a vague recollection of a card which had an American flag
on it and some very patriotic phraseology about the war effort and
the alliance between our country and the Soviet Union. It may have
even had some words about the Communist Party on it. But it seemed
to me entirely innocuous. In fact, again it appeared to be directed
to the things I was interested in, in the war effort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Did you pay dues to the Communist Party after
signing the Communist Party card?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I believe there was some sort of dues structure,
but I don’t remember now how it worked. There were these materials
for sale at the meetings, and money changed hands. I don’t remember
now how much of it was for books, how much of it was for dues.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Over what period of time did you continue to participate
in such meetings and in what you then considered to be
Communist Party activity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, I find it hard to set the actual dates, but it
was, I think, some time during the latter part of 1943 and 1944.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. And thereafter you have never in any way whatsoever
participated in any Communist Party activity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. That isn’t the truth, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. What would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I also attended some similar meetings when I was
in Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The committee will stand in recess until 2 o’clock.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:03 p. m., a recess was taken until 2 p. m. this
same day.)</p>

<h2 id="AFTERNOON_SESSION450">AFTERNOON SESSION, MARCH 19, 1955</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The committee will be in order, please.</p>

<h3 id="JOHN_STENHOUSE450">TESTIMONY OF JOHN STENHOUSE, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL,
JACK R. CLUCK&mdash;Resumed</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Stenhouse, we were discussing the Communist
Party branch or group of which you were a member in Los Angeles.
Will you give the committee, please, the names of those who were
associated with you in that group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I am unable to give you the names, Mr. Tavenner.
It is a long time ago, and I have been trying to remember. As I
indicated to you the other day, if you give me some ideas of whom
you think were present, it might refresh my memory.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I believe I told you that we would try to present
you with a list of persons who had been identified in the Los Angeles
area as members of the Communist Party, but we do not have that
list with us, and we are unable to present it to you now. We may do
so later in an effort to refresh your recollection.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I am willing at any time to tell you if any particular
individual in my recollection was at those meetings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you tell the committee, please, how you became
employed in the United States Department of Commerce in Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, as I indicated, after I was obliged to have my
hernia operation and get out of the defense work that I had been doing
I sought occupation in a number of places. And somewhere along the
line somebody brought my qualifications in the Far East to Congressman
Ellis Patterson, and he referred it to Henry Wallace, and the
appointment was made on that introduction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you finally become head of your Section in the
Department of Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Chief of the Section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was that the Section dealing with China?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did your activities in the Department of Commerce
have anything to do with known Communists in China?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No. The work that I was doing was related to the
rehabilitation of trade. We were answering the inquiries of businessmen
relating to regulations and economic conditions in China and
the Far East. We prepared articles for the Foreign Commerce Weekly
and conducted an economic analysis of the possibilities of reopening
trade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you tell the committee that you attended Communist
Party meetings in the city of Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was that during the entire period of time you were
in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I can’t be sure of the time again. But it was somewhere
between the end of, I think, somewhere between the end of 1945
and the end of 1946.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How soon after your arrival in Washington did you
become identified with the Communist Party there, and attend those
group meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I can’t place it. I know that shortly after I got to
Washington I had another serious operation, and I was busy getting
adjusted to my new work. Sometime about then I joined the Federal
Workers Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. I did not understand you. You joined what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. The Federal Workers Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was it after you became a member of the Federal
Workers Union that you first began attending Communist Party meetings
in the District of Columbia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I can’t be sure. I think it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you advance to the point of holding an office
of any type in the union while you were in Washington?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I was a shop steward and collected dues from 4
or 5 people. That was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you tell the committee, please, the circumstances
under which you were approached to identify yourself with
the Communist Party while you were working for the Department of
Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, again I think it was that one of the fellows
in the union asked me to attend some of the similar sort of meetings
that I had before. But it is possible that it was from some contact
in Los Angeles. I am not sure about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did that individual indicate that he knew you had
been associated with a branch of the Communist Party in Los Angeles
when he first talked to you about attending such meetings in the
District of Columbia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I don’t remember whether he did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Who was the person that contacted you in
Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, again I can’t remember his name. But I
have already told you who I thought it was in terms of his union
function. He was a member of the grievance committee in that department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Can you give a better identification of the individual
than the fact he was with the grievance committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, I can give you a physical description to
some extent. He was a fairly short fellow and dark, dark hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. About what age person was he at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Oh, I imagine maybe 30, 32; something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Where did he live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I don’t know. He may have lived in Virginia.
I say that because one of the houses where we met was in Virginia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was it his house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I am not sure now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was he also employed by the Department of Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was his position in the Department of
Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. He was in the Balance of Payments. I am not
sure of the actual name of the division. The work of that division
was related to the study and report of international balance of
payments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Can you tell us where his office was located in the
Department of Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No. It was a huge building and I don’t remember
what floor it was on. It was in the main building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was it on the same floor as your office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Can you give us his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No; I can’t sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were all of the members of this group employees in
the Department of Commerce?</p>

<p>(Representative Harold H. Velde entered the hearing room at
this point.)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I am not sure of that. I think they were. I
identified them in my mind at least with members of the Public
Workers Union. And, while I was&mdash;well, I was going to say with
that local. But I am not sure of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the number of the local?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I don’t remember. I only attended about, oh, not
more than 4 or 5 union meetings. I dropped out of the union
around the end of 1946, I think it was. And, as a matter of fact,
I was extremely busy in my work and wasn’t actually familiar with
the organization of the union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You were active enough in the union to be made
a steward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. That is right. I was a shop steward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was it your duty, as a shop steward, to represent
the membership of the union in legitimate grievances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, we never had any. And all I did was collect
dues and turn them over to another fellow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were any of the persons from whom you collected
union dues members of the group of the Communist Party to which
you referred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No. No; I don’t think they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was this a mixed group, men and women?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. In the discussion group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes; I think it was only men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How many?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Four or five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you give us the names, if you can, of any of the
members of the group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No, sir, I can’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. You have referred several times to the discussion
group. Can you tell us what you discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, we discussed international affairs, domestic
problems; we discussed articles, as I indicated before, in Communist
and other publications.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. In any of these groups were you ever addressed by
prominent Communist officials or leaders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. In those discussion groups?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Not that I know of. They were all people, as far
as I could determine, just like myself, maybe temporarily off on a
wrong track. There was never any use of fictitious names as far as I
know. I didn’t use a fictitious name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Will you repeat over what period of time did you
attend discussion groups when you were in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, it was some time between the latter part of
1945 and 1946.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Mr. Chairman, it seems unusual to me that the witness
cannot remember anybody’s name, or the name of any person who
attended these meetings.</p>

<p>This occurred less than 10 years ago, did it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. About 10 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. And you cannot remember the name of a single person
who attended those discussion groups?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No. And I have tried to do it, and I have offered
to cooperate to the best of my ability with the staff of your committee,
sir.</p>

<p>It is, as you say, 10 years ago. I have moved out into a different
part of the world, an entirely different environment, new thoughts.
Since I have been out here I have been working hard to establish
myself economically, and I haven’t had association within that time
to remind me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Have you conscientiously tried to search your memory,
to review the history of that period to determine whether you could
name any persons who attended these meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I have, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did you say you have consulted with our staff to determine
whether or not they can refresh your memory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Of course, it still seems odd to me that you cannot remember
one single person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, as a matter of fact, I can’t remember the
names of people whom I was in much more direct contact with in
those days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. You are a very intelligent person. There is no question
about that. It does seem to me that you could remember someone
that you went with. But can’t you remember the occasion of your
first visit to one of these discussion groups?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Or how you happened to get to the meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I don’t remember where it was. It was apparently
in the house of one of the members of the group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Do you remember the physical surroundings of the
meeting place? Apparently it was in a home of one of the members
of the group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. One of the meetings, as I recall, was in, I think
it was an apartment in one of the projects over on the Virginia side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. On that occasion can you remember anyone discussing
any particular legislation; for instance, legislation pending at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No; I can’t. They were very&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Can you recall the name of any individual discussing
any particular item?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No, I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. By physical description?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No. They were very informal discussions. We
just exchanged ideas back and forth. Somebody had read an article
out of a paper or one of the publications, and we discussed it, and
that was about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Your impression was, however, that it was a Communist
Party discussion group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes, that is my impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did you discuss Marxism?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. You cannot recall what you discussed except that you
vaguely remember it was a Communist Party discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I say we were discussing foreign affairs, domestic
problems. I remember at that time the question of price control was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
in people’s minds, and I am pretty sure that that was one of the things
we discussed.</p>

<p>They were nothing more nor less than an attempt, from a certain
viewpoint, to study and explain, if you like, the phenomena we were
living in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Have you no independent recollection whatsoever of
how you happened to get into the first meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Except that I was invited, as far as I remember,
by this fellow that I have described.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. But do you remember his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I probably saw him not more than, oh, 20 times
during the whole time I was in Washington. And there were many
people in Washington whom I saw every day, whose names I can’t
remember.</p>

<p>Another thing, Mr. Congressman, we discussed the same topics from
a different viewpoint with other people. And it is very hard to remember
now exactly which topic was discussed at which meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I am sure, Mr. Stenhouse, it is very hard to remember
exactly. But certainly I think that a person of average intelligence
and a fair memory could remember at least one person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. If I could name them I would. And in offering to
go over a list of names, I have done the best I can to cooperate with
your committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. When you filed your application for Government
employment did you file Government form 57?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you remember the names of the persons you gave
as references on that application?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, if form 57 requires references, I don’t&mdash;&mdash;
Maybe it wasn’t form 57. I don’t want this to be misinterpreted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. It is a standard application form required by governmental
departments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I don’t recall any application in which I put references.
It may be so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. But you did make a written application setting forth
your experience and qualifications?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. And was there an oath on that application?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Which you had to sign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. And did anyone recommend you for this position to
which you were assigned in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Somebody recommended me in the sense that they
referred my name and qualifications to Ellis Patterson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you know who that person was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I am not sure who it was. We had a large number
of friends from Los Angeles at that time, and it may have been
one of the people that we were active with in that Democratic campaign.
I think it probably was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. When you were made section chief, who was your
immediate superior?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. (Name deleted.)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Did he have anything to do with your promotion
to that position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I am sure he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you remember the names of the persons who were
employed under your immediate supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, there was one fellow just prior to my promotion.
(Name deleted.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. I am not suggesting any of those persons be named
in the record; I am testing your memory as to why you remember
some people with whom you were associated and why you cannot
remember the names of some other people with whom you were closely
associated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I can remember the names of many of the people
in my division because we have exchanged Christmas cards since then,
and I have seen some of them since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. In line with Mr. Velde’s questioning regarding the
first Communist Party meeting to which you referred, how did you
go? By car, by bus, or by train? Was it just as you say, a short
distance? How did you get there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No, I didn’t say it was a short distance. I said it
was in Virginia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. That is not far from the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. We lived in Maryland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. How did you travel to the place of the meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I suppose it was by bus because we didn’t have a
car in those days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. You went by bus over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I say bus. I mean public transportation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Mr. Chairman, I think we ought to make it clear we
have no intention of having the public press or anyone else feel that
any of the persons you mention who were associated with you in your
professional work at that time are connected in any way with the
Communist Party or any of its functions. We have hitherto tried to
make that perfectly clear. The mere fact that you mention a name of
one of your associates should lead no one to believe that he is in any
way connected with it or has been connected with the Communist
Party or Communist Party activities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Did other employees in your section attend any of the
meetings to which you have referred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. In line with Congressman Velde’s suggestion the
names mentioned by you in that connection will be stricken from the
record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I want to make one clarification.</p>

<p>In regard to this matter of references, I don’t want it on the record
that I didn’t give any references. If they were required I suppose I
gave them. But don’t remember now who I gave.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Another point, Mr. Chairman, in regard to this matter of remembering
the names of the people who were at these discussion groups,
there were not more than 3 or 4 meetings as far as I remember. There
were very few in number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. How many meetings did you attend while you were
in Washington?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Three or four; at the most, five; I can’t remember
exactly. They are very limited. I am trying to live back in those
days and pinpoint when it could have been and where they could have
been. And I can identify in a vague way three locations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Were you issued a Communist Party membership
card at any time while you were in Washington, D. C.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. But you still refer to them as Communist Party meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. That is what I understood them to be. I am sure
in my own mind now that I was just on the fringes of this thing,
that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you not describe the meetings in Washington
as being the same type of meetings you attended in Los Angeles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I said they were similar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Doesn’t that mean the same type?</p>

<p>What difference was there between the meetings you attended in
Washington and those you attended in Los Angeles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, I suppose one difference would be that in
Washington, D. C., to the best of my knowledge, all the people present
were members of the union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Were they also all employees in the Department of
Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Were any of them employees in your immediate
section?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The China Section of the Department of Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you, of your own personal knowledge, know
whether any of the persons attending those meetings were members
of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, they were at the meetings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Yes; but that isn’t my point. They were at the
meetings, but do you know of your own personal knowledge whether
or not they were Communist Party members?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Why I don’t know how you identify that exactly.
I don’t recall seeing anybody’s card. Again, there was some sort of
dues payment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you recall hearing any one of them say that they
were members of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I can’t remember now whether they did or not.
I was there and I thought I was some sort of a member, and I just
assumed&mdash;Maybe I shouldn’t assume it. But I just assumed they
were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you pay dues in this organization or in this
group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, again, it was somewhat the same arrangement
as before. There were books to be bought and some sort of
dues arrangement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. To whom did you pay the dues?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, I don’t remember who the individual was.
The money was just&mdash;somebody said “Well, here are the books.” And
the money was put on the table.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How long did you remain a member of that group or
attend meetings of that group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, that is the question that you asked before,
and, as I told you, I find it very difficult to pinpoint the time. I think
I can limit it to somewhere near the end of 1945 because of the
fact that I didn’t get there until June and I had the operation, and
then my family came out, and we were preoccupied with getting
into a house and things of that sort. And I think it was&mdash;I was out
of it by the early part of 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. So that you continued until the early part of
1947?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, I say it was somewhere in that area. And
I can’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you tell the committee, please, the circumstances
under which you stopped attending these meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, the Communist publications that we were
studying seemed to be overready to excuse the Soviet Union and
criticize our country, and this didn’t jibe with the ideas that I had had
about the situation during the war. And I just stopped going and
nobody ever tried to get me back in or approached me in any way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You have said that you cannot recall the names
of any of these people or give any more descriptive information than
you have because of the lapse of time, and the fact that you are
separated now by long distance from the place you were then.</p>

<p>Did anything occur in 1946 or 1947 which would have served to
refresh your recollection as to who these individuals were?</p>

<p>Something that would have called this matter very definitely to
your attention and would have impressed itself on your memory.
Do you recall anything of an unusual character having occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I suppose you are referring to the fact that I was
investigated or questioned by the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. It may have recalled their names to me then, but
it doesn’t now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did you give any names to the FBI when you were
questioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. You said it may have recalled some of the names to you
at that time but it doesn’t now. If at that time it recalled the names
of people with whom you had associated, why didn’t you give them
to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I declined to state whether or not I had been a
member of the Communist Party in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Do you mean you declined to state to the FBI whether
or not you had been a member of the Communist Party in Los
Angeles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes. And, as far as I remember, he told me I
didn’t have to state. I can’t be sure of that, but that is my recollection.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Of course, you don’t have to tell the FBI anything.
But I am just wondering what was in your mind at that time&mdash;the
reason why you did not give the FBI that information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. The reason was that I had, to the best of my
knowledge and conscience, done nothing hostile to the United States.
In fact, I thought that I had been a very loyal and active citizen in
promoting the war effort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. When did your employment terminate with the
Department of Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I got my termination notice in October, and it was
effective in November of 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the reason for termination of your
services?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. It stated that I was being relieved due to a reduction
in force.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I believe you stated then your next employment was
with the United Nations. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you tell the committee, please, how you obtained
your employment with the United Nations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, I was trying many avenues to get employment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am referring only to your employment with the
United Nations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, there may have been a number of channels
through which I got it, but I think that it may have been through the
Institute of Pacific Relations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Why did you appeal to the Institute of Pacific
Relations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Because I had been a subscriber to the Institute of
Pacific Relations, and I knew of the Institute as one interested in
far-eastern affairs. And that, amongst several dozens of business
firms and organizations, seemed to be a likely place to find an occupation
in the area where I wanted to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Before going to the Institute of Pacific Relations,
did you have in mind that you desired to secure a position with the
United Nations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No; I don’t think I did. In fact&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was the suggestion then made to you by the Institute
of Pacific Relations that you seek employment with the United
Nations?</p>

<p>(At this point Representative Morgan M. Moulder left the hearing
room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I think it was suggested to me there that this commission
was being formed&mdash;the commission was already in effect, but
that there was this job to do on this subcommittee of trade relations
and that I should contact a Dr. Lokanath. He was an Indian
economist.</p>

<p>(At this point Representative Morgan M. Moulder returned to the
hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I think that may have been the channel through
which it came. I am not entirely certain. But I did contact him and
got the appointment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did the person or persons with whom you conferred
in the Institute of Pacific Relations know of your Communist Party
membership?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you furnish any references to the Institute of
Pacific Relations when you went there to confer on the subject of your
employment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I think I probably did. You mean a sort of curriculum
vitae.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The real purpose of my question is to find out
whether or not you were recommended to the Institute of Public Relations
by any person who knew you had been a member of the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No. I went there entirely on my own initiative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did you know any of the defendants in the Amerasia
case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Had you ever met any of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Do you know who it was from the Institute of Pacific
Relations who first interested you in the United Nations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I was interested in the United Nations myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Naturally, I suppose you were. Was any one person
at the Institute of Pacific Relations responsible for your employment
by the United Nations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No. I went to the Institute of Pacific Relations as
one of many, many sources for a new occupation. And in the office
of the Institute of Pacific Relations I was told that there was this
opening. So I applied to the United Nations. I have at home a file
about that thick [indicating] of letters to many business firms that I
wrote to and had interviews with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Do you have any written memorandums or anything
else in writing that would show your contact with the Institute of
Pacific Relations at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I have nothing to hide about my Institute of Pacific
Relations contacts. I was a subscriber to the Institute of Pacific
Relations. I thought they were doing a good job of objective reporting
on the Far East. I was interested in it because of my background.</p>

<p>While I was in Washington, D. C., I went to several Institute of
Pacific Relations meetings and discussion groups. It was only natural
that that should be one place where I would go to find out if there
was any firm or any organization that was associated with the Far
East who would be interested in my background.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Of course, I don’t want to cast any reflections on the
individual members of the Institute of Pacific Relations or any others
you have contacted, but I do feel it would be valuable to the committee
if you would make available the various letters you used when applying
for jobs in order that we might search our records. Would you
be willing to make those available?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Do you want me to tell you the names of the people
in the Institute of Pacific Relations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. No. I am not particularly anxious for that. Again,
I want to say if you do mention names of persons in the Institute of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
Pacific Relations, it should be no reflection upon them whatsoever
because you, as a former Communist, contacted them.</p>

<p>I am interested in finding out who you contacted or who in the Institute
of Pacific Relations recommended you for a job with the United
Nations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I haven’t been asked that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I ask you that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. If you want to know who it was in the Institute
of Pacific Relations who I think gave me the information, I am very
frank to tell you that it was Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Do you know his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Edward C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Was he in his office at the time you went to the Institute
of Pacific Relations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. What did he do to promote your appointment in the
United Nations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. He may have contacted Dr. Lokanath, for all I
know. I think he possibly did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did you get recommendations from members of the
Institute of Pacific Relations other than Mr. Carter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did you have recommendations of any kind other than
the Institute of Pacific Relations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>The chief of my division gave me a very fine recommendation. A
colleague who was in the China legal section gave me a very fine
recommendation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did either Mr. Carter or the chief of your division
know that you were a member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No; they did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. What type of formal application did you make for the
position you sought and afterward obtained in the United Nations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I don’t recall now any formal application. I have
in my files a letter of appointment, but I don’t recall a formal application.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Proceed, Mr. Counsel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. After accepting the position with the United Nations,
were you sent on a project to China?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Before your selection for that project, were you
interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. When was it you were interviewed by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation at which time you refused to advise them as
to your previous Communist Party membership?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, I think you gave me the date of that the
other day. I had forgotten it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Don’t you remember it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No; I don’t. But you said it was in 1946, and I
think it probably was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. So before you were selected for the position in the
United Nations and, particularly for this project in China, you had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
refused to give information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation
as to whether or not you had been a member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, that is true, some nearly 2 years before. By
the time I had applied for the position in the United Nations I didn’t
consider myself to be whatever it was I had been before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And no governmental agency, after the FBI came
to see you, ever made any inquiry until the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, that is not so.</p>

<p>Last September I was called by a Treasury representative, and he
told me he wanted to ask me some questions. So I met him at my
home and he started to ask me about the sort of work I did and whether
I ever did much traveling. And in the course of that discussion I
told him that I had been in Washington, D. C. I told him quite
frankly what I had been doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you tell him you had been a member of the
Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No. He didn’t ask me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was that the first time you had been questioned
along this line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>, Yes. But he did ask me a question did I know
a certain individual in Washington, D. C. And the name of the man
was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I would suggest that you not mention the name in
public. The committee, I think, would want to know privately.</p>

<p>Let me ask you this:</p>

<p>In seeking that information from you, did it have any connection
with the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I don’t know what his intentions were at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I think, Mr. Chairman, under those circumstances,
we should not ask him to state the matter in public when we have no
idea what it is he is talking about.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. You asked me if I had ever been questioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I mean questioned about communism in a Federal
agency and regarding the matters under discussion here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I beg your pardon. I thought you meant had I
ever been questioned by an agency of the Government in the interim.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Of course, we are not interested in whether you
have been interrogated by someone in a Government department on
matters not at all related to the functions of this committee. I understand
you to say you have not been.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. The reason I thought you might be interested in
it was that he did ask me a question which related to the Institute of
Pacific Relations. And since it related to that, I thought that the
committee should know about it.</p>

<p>He asked me if I had ever known (name deleted).</p>

<p>And first I couldn’t remember the name. But then he said, “Well,
didn’t you ever go to a luncheon in Washington, D. C., sponsored by
the Institute of Pacific Relations?”</p>

<p>And then I remembered that I had, along with several hundred or
so other people, gone to such a luncheon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, this being a matter about which we
have no knowledge at all, I believe we are getting into a field that
should not be explored in public without some investigation on our
own part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Mr. Tavenner, will you step up here, please?</p>

<p>(Mr. Tavenner confers with the chairman.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. May I make one concluding remark as to that last
testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. At this time the name you mentioned will be stricken
from the record until further investigation can be made of your last
testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, this individual, I may say, addressed a large
group of people in what was substantially an open meeting, and reported
on&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, in light of your ruling, I suggest
we not go into that matter at all until the committee staff has had
an opportunity to investigate the witness’ last testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I make one concluding statement
in regard to my last remarks?</p>

<p>When the man who was questioning me heard my report he then
asked me why I was changing jobs. And I said I had no intention to
change a job. And he said, “Did you apply for a job with the Treasury
Department?”</p>

<p>And I said, “No.”</p>

<p>And he said, “Well, do you know another John Stenhouse?”</p>

<p>And I told him I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you tell the committee, please, the purpose of
the project on which you were sent to China?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I think I have already stated that. Do you want
me to repeat it, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. It was to study and report on the rehabilitation of
trade in the Far East.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And that necessitated your travel in what part of
China?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. The headquarters were in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you spend all of your time in Shanghai?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No. I was in Nanking&mdash;well, while I was with
that particular commission I spent all of my time in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. When was it that you went to Nanking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. After 3 months with the Economic Commission I
then was with the Food and Agriculture Administration, and the
Food and Agriculture Administration had an office both in Shanghai
and in Nanking. And it was my duty, as administrative assistant, to
supervise both offices.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you state the dates you were stationed in
Shanghai, and the dates you were in Nanking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I can’t do it. I was back and forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you state the dates which divided your time
between the two places?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I think maybe there is a mistake in my previous
testimony as to dates.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span></p>

<p>Could the recorder&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Rather than to take the time to look that up, if you
give us what you consider to be the correct dates now, we will understand
if that is different from what you stated before that you are
thereby correcting the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I think I went to Shanghai in April&mdash;April, May,
June, with the Commission. And then June, July, August, or something
like that, with Food and Agriculture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Of what year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Were you a member of the Communist Party at that
time, Mr. Stenhouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you define your duties in the various assignments
you held while in China?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, on the Commission it was research and
analysis and reporting, and I wrote a report on the problems of reestablishing
interregional trade in the Far East. And it was published
by the United Nations&mdash;not under my name, but incorporated in a
much larger volume.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you identify the volume and the article for the
use of the committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. It must have been published. I suppose it was
published in 1949 probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Under what caption?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I don’t remember that. It was published by the
Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East as a subsidiary
agency of the United Nations. But my material wasn’t any single
article. It was incorporated with a lot of other material by a lot of
other people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In other words, your article was used as source
material in the preparation of a report by the United Nations. Is that
what you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. During your assignment in China were you required
to confer with known members of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Or Communists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, I want to be frank here, but, first of all, I
would like you to tell me in the context of Chinese people what the
definition of a Communist is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Living in China as long as you did, you probably
should understand that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. That is very difficult. The longer you live in
China the harder it is to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Were you conferring with the economic leaders in
China when you were on this assignment with the United Nations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Was China under Communist domination at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. It certainly wasn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. When was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. At that time then you didn’t actually know whether
you were dealing with Chiang Kai-shek forces or the Red forces?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. At that time, Mr. Congressman, Shanghai was
still under the Nationalists, and we dealt with officials of the Nationalist
Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Then you certainly wouldn’t expect them to be Communists.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I wouldn’t expect it, but there were many, I suppose&mdash;from
what I know now&mdash;there were Communists in Shanghai
at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. As leaders in the Nationalist Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Well, the reason why I asked for the definition
was we are always running into this problem of what is a Communist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. There was nothing wrong in you conferring with Communists
at that time; understand that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I want to answer the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Or with Nationalists either. That was part of your
duties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I asked for the definition because one of the men
who was a consultant&mdash;and I didn’t appoint him&mdash;to the group that
I was working with was the chief of the Foreign Exchange Department
of the Bank of China.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Do you recall his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Yes. Chi Chio Ting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. You certainly do have a good recollection as to some
of these people, and you fail to recollect other people, chiefly Communists,
with whom you were associated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. China is my field. I remember him because he was
related to an area that I have since had contact with. And I remember
him, too, because shortly after&mdash;I think it was shortly after I left
Shanghai or while I was still there&mdash;he went over to the Peking
Government. And, as far as I know, that is the only contact that I
had in Shanghai with anything that you could call a Communist.
And I don’t know that he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Certainly I am sure, as Mr. Tavenner has very well
stated, that you, being acquainted in China, would certainly have a
lot better knowledge of communism in China than probably any of
us here would. I would like to ask if you recognized any of those
associated with you on the United Nations Commission in China as
being what you consider Communists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. The answer to that question is “No.”</p>

<p>This particular individual was acting only in the capacity of a consultant.
And I don’t think he was actually a member of the United
Nations. We were consulting with him and people like him because
we were concerned with finance and foreign exchange and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I suggest that if the committee
desires to go into the Chinese phase of that matter carefully that it
be done at some other time. I believe, with the witnesses we have
here, we would not be able to complete the work that is outlined if
we attempt to go into that matter now. Besides, I think it is a
matter we should discuss with the witness, at least preliminarily,
before attempting to have a public hearing on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I would be very happy to do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Let me say this, Mr. Chairman: I am disappointed at
the witness’ lack of memory concerning his early Communist associations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
and his inability to identify the members of the group with which
he associated. However, I do feel that the information the witness
possesses would be valuable to this committee, and he certainly should
be given an opportunity to refresh his memory on any of these aspects
as much as possible.</p>

<p>I would suggest our staff immediately prepare, or start an investigation
into the matters related here today so we might hold a future
hearing to secure more valuable information than we have today.
And in that connection I would suggest that the subpena to this
witness be continued until some future date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Mr. Stenhouse, the subpena which was served upon
you will remain in full force and effect until you are otherwise notified,
or notified to appear here as a witness before this committee in further
open session.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I make a short statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. You will not be entitled to make a statement. You
mean you want to ask a question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stenhouse</span>. I just wanted to refer once more to this matter of
remembering the names. There were not more than 5 of these meetings.
They occurred in a context where I was discussing the same sort
of subjects in many different groups with many different individuals
with many different points of view. As I said before, I cannot remember
the names of people with whom I was in daily contact at that
time.</p>

<p>I have moved out of that part of the country. I have very few associations
with it. It is entirely impossible for me to drag names out of
the air.</p>

<p>If the committee or its staff will be able to submit names to me I
will do my best to say whether or not I can remember those people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. That is the purpose of continuing in force and effect
your subpena. And you are now temporarily excused as a witness.</p>

<p>(Whereupon the witness was temporarily excused.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Call the next witness, Mr. Tavenner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Dennett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The name of the witness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Dennett.</p>

<h3 id="Eugene_Victor_Dennett466">TESTIMONY OF EUGENE VICTOR DENNETT, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS
COUNSEL, KENNETH A. MacDONALD&mdash;Resumed</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Dennett, I would like you to resume at this
point the identification of individuals who were prominent in Communist
Party activities in this area during the period that you were
a member of the CIO council.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Mr. Chairman, there is one fellow that came to my
mind after I left the stand here in connection with the Boeing plant,
a fellow by the name of Sam Telford, who was very well known to
me at that time.</p>

<p>Telford was very active in the organization of young people. His
wife, Kate, was one of the principal workers in the office of the International
Woodworkers of America. I happen to recall that because
Kate and I had one thing in common&mdash;we had both attended church
when we were young and had learned a number of hymns. And
whenever social affairs occurred she and I would be singing hymns.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
And it seemed to grate on the nerves of the comrades. They wanted
to know if we didn’t know some revolutionary songs, and we got a
big kick out of irritating them with that.</p>

<p>I have quit singing, however. My voice doesn’t suit for that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you recall whether the first name was Kate or
Kay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I knew her by the name of Kate, K-a-t-e.</p>

<p>Now the other day Mr. Wheeler asked me to think of the names of
persons whom I knew, and I wrote down those which came to my mind
in an offhand sort of way. Now in speaking of these names I want
to again reiterate my personal moral objection to being called upon
to bring to public notice the names of people whom I did know in the
Communist Party for the reason that I think it is much better for
them to speak for themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Just a moment. If you can devise some plan for
Communists speaking for themselves without the committee ascertaining
their names we would be glad to have the suggestion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Maybe when I get through they might want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I might say the committee has to take the responsibility
for asking you these questions, and realizes that it is not being
generously given.</p>

<p>(At this point Representative Harold H. Velde left the hearing
room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Well, I make the point of my objection for the reason
that among nearly all of my friends are people who believe in bending
over backwards the other way to protect the good name of any person.
And I fear the consequences to the individuals.</p>

<p>I mean I just hate to be a party to doing anything which will in
anywise injure any of them. I trust that the way in which this is
done it will not injure them. However, I know that they are going
to suffer some embarrassment as a consequence of it. However, the
names that I am going to submit to you are persons who were known
to me to be members of the Communist Party, and I am sure they
knew what they were doing when they were members of the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>These names are somewhat scattered. In order to expedite the
business, I think I should go down through those that I have not
previously mentioned to you, and make their identification so that
we can get on to other matters which I know counsel wishes to cover.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Please proceed.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Long ago, I knew a man by the name of Revels Cayton,
who was the head of the International Labor Defense.</p>

<p>C-a-y-t-o-n is the last name, Revels&mdash;R-e-v-e-l-s, the first name.</p>

<p>Later, I knew Mr. Cayton as an official in the Marine Cooks and
Stewards of the Pacific union.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Way back in the unemployed days I knew a man by the name of
Iver Moe, I-v-e-r M-o-e.</p>

<p>Iver Moe’s importance and significance is that he led an unemployed
demonstration in Anacortes to a privately owned store which had
foodstuffs in its stock, and the populace of Anacortes helped themselves.
Mr. Moe was one of the leaders of that group, and was prosecuted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
for it. He was a member of the Communist Party at the time
he did this. He thought he was doing the right thing. And, as a
consequence, he was put on trial and was convicted and sentenced, and
I know that he was turned against the Communist Party as a consequence
of that experience.</p>

<p>(At this point Representative Harold H. Velde returned to the
hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Another person known to me in the unemployed days
was a lady by the name of Mrs. Harter, H-a-r-t-e-r. Her significance
to me is that she later became the wife of Alex Noral, before he left
here. He took her with him as his wife to California.</p>

<p>She was a very active person in the unemployed movement, in the
unemployed councils.</p>

<p>Later on, I knew Mr. Terry Pettus, who was the editor of the New
World, and now the northwest edition of the People’s World.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you spell the name, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. P-e-t-t-u-s, Pettus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Are all the names you are referring to individuals
who once were, or who now are, members of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. They were known to me at the time I was in the
Communist Party as members of the Communist Party, and I had
Communist business with them.</p>

<p>Another person’s name was Jim Cour, C-o-u-r or C-o-u-e-r. I am
not too sure of that spelling.</p>

<p>But Jim Cour was in an editorial capacity on the old Voice of
Action, which was the predecessor of the present paper, the northwest
edition of the People’s World. In between the name changed many
times. At one time they had the New World, and, another time, it
had several different names. But it was the same organization, the
same subscribers, the same leadership. The change of name was intended
to more adequately satisfy the attitude of the public toward
political questions at that particular moment.</p>

<p>There was another one by the name of Bill Corr, but his was spelled
differently, and it was C-o-r-r. Bill Corr was in the business management
end of the paper, the Voice of Action.</p>

<p>Later I knew a person by the name of Huber, L. R. It seems to
me that his first name was Louis, L-o-u-i-s. He served as editor of
the Lumberworkers’ paper for a long period of time, that is, the paper
issued by the International Woodworkers of America, at the time
that Harold Pritchett was the president of the organization.</p>

<p>Another person whom I knew was Charles Daggett. Charles Daggett
I knew in several different capacities. At one time he was the
city editor of the Seattle Star, a paper which went out of business in
Seattle a great number of years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Daggett later was known to me as an official in the inlandboatmen’s
union,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> having become elected business agent in the San
Francisco branch of the organization, and got into financial difficulties
there; later went to Los Angeles. That is the last I heard of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. We have seen him since then, and he has testified
before this committee and admitted his Communist Party membership.</p>

<p>Did you know him in this area in any activity within the newspaper
guild?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes, I knew him in the newspaper guild, but I was
not certain of his Communist Party activity at the time that I knew
him then. I knew him as a Communist just as he left here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was he active in that field in Los Angeles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes, he was. He was very active as a newspaperman.
He had a great deal to do with three other newspaper people whom
I became closely acquainted with because of the official position that
they held in the organization.</p>

<p>The first was a person by the name of Ellen McGrath. I have heard
since that she is deceased. But Ellen McGrath was a sort of business
agent for the newspaper guild when it was first organized here, and
I knew her both in the official capacity as a representative of the newspaper
guild and as a Communist actively operating in that field.</p>

<p>I knew her successor in that field, a man by the name of Claude
Smith. Claude Smith was also known to me at that time as a Communist.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes, he is the one who was expelled from the Party
at the same time that I was subsequently.</p>

<p>I knew another person by the name of Robert Camozzi, C-a-m-o-z-z-i.
Robert Camozzi was the president of the Seattle CIO council
at the time I was its secretary, and we had official business representing
the council, and also we had official business as Communists.</p>

<p>In the building service union,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> in addition to Mr. Jess Fletcher,
whom I knew quite well because of his work on the district bureau
of the Communist Party, I also knew a man by the name of Merwin
Cole, C-o-l-e. Merwin Cole was one of the business agents of that
union, and was quite well known to me because I had tried very hard
to recruit him during some of the peace demonstrations that the
youth from the university had organized downtown some time in
the summer of 1936, I believe. Or perhaps it was 1935. It may
have been a year one way or the other.</p>

<p>I also knew one of his associates, Mr. Ward Coley, who was a business
agent in that union, C-o-l-e-y.</p>

<p>I knew another man by the name of Daggett. His name is Herbert
Daggett. He is a brother of Charles Daggett. Herbert Daggett
was known to me as a Communist in the National Marine Engineers’
Beneficial Association. Herbert Daggett was some official there. I
do not recall exactly what it was at that time. I do not know as to
his political position as of the present time either. I do understand
that he is now the president of the Marine Engineers’ Beneficial Association
with headquarters in Washington, D. C. I repeat that I do
not know what his political attitude is now.</p>

<p>He had an associate in the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association
by the name of Ted Rasmussen. Rasmussen, I am not sure of the
spelling. There are several different ways of spelling that name,
and I am not positive of it. You will have to take the best guess you
can make. But Ted was a member of the marine engineers organization,
and I knew him as a Communist. I am not sure whether I am
the person who recruited him, but I think I am because at the time
I first started to work in the Inlandboatmen’s Union Ted Rasmussen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
was the organizer of a dissident group of engineers who wanted to
separate themselves from the existing organization. And I worked
very hard to persuade him not to split the organization, and finally
did prevail upon him, with the assistance of Harry Jackson, who was
the Communist leader in the trade-union field here at that time, and
either Mr. Jackson or myself recruited Mr. Rasmussen.</p>

<p>In the lumber organization I recall the name of Ted Dokter,
D-o-k-t-e-r. Ted Dokter was a very able man in the lumber industry,
and we thought he was very efficient, and we liked his work at the
time I knew him. Later, after I ceased to know him personally and
directly, I heard criticism of him to the effect that he did not follow the
party line. So I don’t know what has happened to him.</p>

<p>Of course, I knew Dick and Laura Law. Both are now deceased.</p>

<p>I have previously mentioned Helen Sobeleski and Gladys Field
who were in the woodworkers’ office.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>One of my successors in the Seattle CIO Council was a man by the
name of Arthur Harding. He was known to me. I understand he is
deceased. I have not known of him for several years. But he was
a loyal party member and so was his wife, a Jean Harding, J-e-a-n.</p>

<p>I have previously mentioned Ernie Fox, who was in the Sailors
Union of the Pacific.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Let me suggest that we not lose time by repeating
any of those that you have already named.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I knew his wife very well. She went by the name
of Elsie Gilland, G-i-l-l-a-n-d. One day a very peculiar thing occurred
to me. Mr. Harry Jackson came to me with a request. He said
that he had received an application card from a Mr. Roy Atkinson,
and asked me whether I felt Mr. Atkinson could possibly really mean
to join the Communist Party.</p>

<p>I expressed my belief that I didn’t think he could because I had
never seen anything on his behavior which would indicate any sympathy
toward the Communist Party. He said, “Well, we have received
an application from him. We have received dues. Instead
of doing anything about it we will not issue a card to him, and we will
not let him be assigned to any branch. We are suspicious of that application.
So we will not honor it.” Mr. Atkinson was an active
official in the CIO, and I thought that it was quite a ridiculous thing
myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In other words, you thought that he desired to join
the Communist Party in order to obtain information of its activities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That was my opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Rather than to become genuinely a member of the
Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Two persons who came to this area from the national office were
known very well to me, Mr. Andrew Remes&mdash;and I know that that
is not his proper name&mdash;but I don’t know what his proper name was.
That was a party name. And it was always spelled R-e-m-e-s, as
far as I remember.</p>

<p>One of his associates, who also came from the East, was Mr. Lou
Sass&mdash;S-a-s-s.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span></p>

<p>The committee will probably remember testimony from Mr. Leonard
Wildman to the effect that he knew me in the Communist Party,
which is correct. I did know him in the Communist Party.</p>

<p>I also knew his wife, Muriel. I also knew Elizabeth Boggs, who
gave testimony to the effect that she knew me in the Communist Party.</p>

<p>I knew Mr. Harold Johnston, who was on this stand here this morning.
Mr. Johnston was known to me as an active Communist and
a close associate of Mr. Morris Rappaport.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Was he a Communist at the time you left the Communist
Party, to your best knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I had no direct knowledge as to what Mr. Johnston’s
position was after I went in the service. I did not know him after
1942-43. But I understand he was quite amused over my remark that
Mr. Rappaport made short work of me. He was in a position to know.</p>

<p>I knew Mr. Glenn Kinney&mdash;K-i-n-n-e-y. I knew him over a period
of a great many years. As a matter of fact, he was one of the first
persons with whom I attempted to build a shop unit out in the steel
mill. I wasn’t employed there at the time. I believe he was. I
was an official working here in town, doing full-time work for the
party. Later on Mr. Kinney became a machinist, or I think he was
a machinist actually at that time, but he became a machinist and rose
to the heights in the machinists’ union,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> at least to the extent of being
a business agent there several times.</p>

<p>In the old days there was an old man known to me by the name
of F. S. U. Smith. And the reason we called him F. S. U. Smith
was because he made one speech wherever he went, and that was to
ask for people to be Friends of the Soviet Union, which was the name
of an organization that he was very ardently supporting. He was a
very loyal man to the party and did the best he knew how and the
best he could.</p>

<p>These that I am scratching off are names that I have previously
mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Mr. Dennett, I wish to apologize and thank you for
your patience in being called and recalled, but we previously set the
recess at 3:30. Do you mind at this time if we have a 5-minute recess
and resume the hearings after it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I would like to finish the names before we recess so
we can take up the other business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. All right; let’s proceed if you wish to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. A very old friend of mine with whom I went to
school&mdash;I have no knowledge as to what has become of him now&mdash;but
at the time I knew him in the Communist Party he was the section
organizer in King County. His name is Al Bristol. Al was a
very fine friend of mine, a very patient fellow. I knew his wife
Frances quite well.</p>

<p>Another official that held the position of section organizer here was
Clayton Van Lydegraf&mdash;V-a-n L-y-d-e-g-r-a-f. Clayton Van Lydegraf
was one of the officials who took part in my expulsion from the
party, signing the expulsion notice.</p>

<p>Another person whom I knew as a Communist was Mr. Earl
Payne&mdash;P-a-y-n-e. The last I heard of him he had been assigned section
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
organizer in the Portland, Oreg., area. When I knew him he had
just returned from serving in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in Spain.</p>

<p>Mr. Philip Frankfeld was sent here by the Central Committee to
take over when Mr. Morris Rappaport was removed, or when it was
known&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. When was Mr. Rappaport removed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. It was about the time of the outbreak of the war,
shortly after the party had to make modifications in its practices
because of the passage of the Voorhis Act. And Mr. Rappaport had
been born in old Russia at the time of the Czar and was one of those
continuing problems to the Immigration Department because no country
would accept him as a deportee. And the Immigration Department
could not dispose of him except to hold him in their jail. He
was one of their problems. And the party, in preparation for its super-patriotic
efforts during the Second World War changed its constitution
to provide that only citizens of the United States, or persons
who were eligible to become citizens of the United States could be
members of the Communist Party. When that was adopted, Mr.
Rappaport could not qualify, and was removed from office in the
Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. In 1941 or 1942?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Well, it was about in that period. I can’t be too
certain of it because I was beginning to fall into some disrepute myself,
and was being left out of many activities and much information.</p>

<p>Another person well known to me in this period was Mr. John
D-a-s-c-h-b-a-c-h. Daschbach was known to me as a comparatively
young man who worked&mdash;I’ll be blessed if I know where he worked,
but I know he was always active in the Communist Party activities.</p>

<p>A longshoreman known to me that I failed to mention this morning
was a rather heavy-set fellow who was known to me in a rather
incidental sort of way. I know he was in the Communist Party, but
I know little of any activity that he took part in, a man by the name
of Wayne Mosio. I am not sure of the spelling. I think it is M-o-s-i-o.
It may be z, but I am not certain.</p>

<p>Another longshoreman who was well known to me as a member of
the Communist Party is a person who broke with the Communist
Party and later changed his occupation from longshoreman to that
of lawyer. He went to school while he was longshoring and qualified
to be admitted to the bar.</p>

<p>I know that he was bitterly anti-Communist long before he became
an attorney. I don’t know whether you wish his name mentioned
or not, but he was known to me and he certainly was known to the
longshoremen. His name was Philip Poth, P-o-t-h.</p>

<p>A national leader of the party whom I failed to mention before was
Mr. John Williamson, one of the Smith Act defendants who suffered
penalty of conviction and incarceration. He served as the trade-union
section or secretary, replacing Mr. Roy Hudson.</p>

<p>A person who was well known to me in my work of attempting to
organize steel workers into the Communist Party was a section organizer,
a man by the name of Charles Legg, L-e-g-g.</p>

<p>Another person known to me as a member of the Communist Party
who later turned up as an informer for the Government and served
as a witness for the FBI was known to me under the name of Doc
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
Dafoe. He was employed at that time in the steel mill at Northwest
Rolling Mills.</p>

<p>Another person well known to me in the Communist Party many
years ago who was rather mild in his Communist Party efforts when I
knew him and who later turned against the Communist Party was
Dan Adair, A-d-a-i-r. He was in Olympia, his home was Olympia.</p>

<p>I also knew his father whose name was Robin Adair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you mean by that you are identifying his father
as a member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes; both of them were members of the Communist
Party at that time. Mr. Dan Adair, the last I heard of him, was
bitterly anti-Communist and has left the State.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I would like to remind you, wherever it is known
to you that a person being identified has left the Communist Party,
that it is only the fair thing to say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. True.</p>

<p>I believe, sir, that covers all the names that I have not covered
before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. We will stand in recess for 5 minutes.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, a short recess was taken.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The committee will please come to order.</p>

<p>Proceed with the witness, please, Mr. Tavenner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Dennett, at the time you were a member of the
CIO Council what union was it that you were representing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I was from the Inlandboatmen’s Union at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I believe you have given us the names of those in
that union who were known to you to be members of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The only ones that I know&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I don’t want you to repeat them. I want to make
certain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The only ones I knew in the Inlandboatmen’s
Union&mdash;two are deceased.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. We are not interested in that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I think that is of no value.</p>

<p>There was a person known to me in the Inlandboatmen’s Union by
the name of Gene Robel, who was a member of the Communist Party
in the Inlandboatmen’s Union. I think that he was one of the witnesses
subpenaed before this hearing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did he testify several days ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you at a later time become a member of the Steel
Workers’ Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What date did you become a member?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Some time in 1942, I think it was. Yes, it was in
1942.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you tell the committee, please, if any members
of that union were known to you to be members of the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I have this recollection about that:</p>

<p>Remember now all of that transpired more than 7 years ago. I
have been expelled from the party for the past 7 years, going on 8.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span></p>

<p>My recollection is positive about 2 persons. There are others about
whom I have a very indistinct recollection, and I would be afraid to be
positive about. But the two that I can be positive about&mdash;one’s name
was Andrew Marshall. He was referred to in Barbara Hartle’s testimony
as Andy. She did not finish the name. He was well known
to me.</p>

<p>Another person was Alex Harding. H-a-r-d-i-n-g.</p>

<p>I know that there were around 6 or 7 active members of the Communist
Party in the steelworkers at that time, but I am so uncertain
about the other names that I would hesitate to mention them for fear
I might be wrong and might speak of the wrong person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. There are other matters that I wanted to obtain
information about, but there is apparently not time to do it.</p>

<p>I wanted particularly to inquire into examples of discipline exercised
by the Communist Party over its members. We shall not have
time to cover that even in a general way, but I know from what you
have said during the course of your testimony that on a number of occasions
the Communist Party disciplined you. You have told us of
two occasions so far. I wish you would tell the committee of other
examples of discipline.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Well, the most important one was my expulsion and
that of my former wife.</p>

<p>This occurred after my return from the service. You will recall
that I have previously indicated that by the time I was inducted into
service I was beginning to fall into some disrepute in the party, and
the reason for that was that I had been actively engaged in trying to
develop a struggle for equal rights for Negroes.</p>

<p>I was very much impressed by cases of police brutality against Negroes
in the city of Seattle way back in 1940 and 1941. And some
special cases had been brought to my personal attention, and I had
developed a rather broad struggle on behalf of those people through
my connections with the Washington Commonwealth Federation.</p>

<p>Of course, I was trying to build a considerable corps of Negro people
in the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Without going into the detail of that, I simply want to say that my
activities at first met with the approval of the Communist Party, but,
with the outbreak of the war and the changed policy of the Communist
Party, my activities met with the sharp disapproval of the party.</p>

<p>In other words, the party adopted the policy during the war of
subordinating all other things in supporting the war. They had a
slogan of “Subordinate the sectional or local interests to the national
interest.” This was quite a sharp change in policy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you construe that as a sharp interest in the policy
of the United States or of some other country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. It was not with respect to the policy of the United
States. It was intended to guarantee that the full strength of the
United States would be brought to bear on the side of the Soviet Union
in the war which was then raging with Nazi Germany; and to guarantee
that it would be complete, the Communist Party ordered that the
fight for equal rights for Negroes should be subordinated and that
Negroes would have to wait for their equal rights, they would have
to cease being troublemakers over this question. And they used that
term. They used that term against me, that I was simply a troublemaker
organizing diversionary interests.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span></p>

<p>Well, I felt that if the war that was being fought was worth anything
it certainly was worth applying the principle of equal rights
throughout the length and breadth of this Nation of the United States,
especially when I knew of the heavy burden which the Negroes were
carrying in parts of this country. And I knew that there were some
attitudes around here which were extremely offensive to the Negro
people. They certainly do object to segregation, and they certainly
have a right to object to it.</p>

<p>It is my feeling, and always has been, that it is the duty of the
white people to see to it that they are not treated as inferiors.</p>

<p>So I was pressing that point, and I defied the leadership of the
district in the party to show me anything anywhere which justified
their change of attitude.</p>

<p>For my militant determination on it I was falling into bad graces
so rapidly that they removed me from the district bureau.</p>

<p>Before I went into the service I also quarreled with them over some
of the literature published under the name of Earl Browder, under
the title of “Victory and After,” in which I challenged some of the
contentions of Browder that it was possible to get along with some of
the big capitalists of the United States in the interest of the war effort
and forget the interest of the workers who were employed by those
capitalists, because in too many instances the capitalists were making
enormous profits in the war but the workers were not increasing their
wages.</p>

<p>This was an issue which was of extreme importance to me. I was
working in a steel mill and I felt that the steelworkers’ wages at that
time were altogether too inadequate. I think that history since has
borne out the justification of my attitude in it, and I think the Communist
Party policy which flip-flopped all over the place at that time
has proven how unstable it was, and has proven that it was not genuinely
trying to improve the condition of the workers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. When were you removed from the district bureau of the
Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Some time in 1941 or 1942, I believe it was. Then,
of course, I went into the service.</p>

<p>Upon return from the service I tried to become as active as possible
in the party work, tried to restore organization of the party apparatus.
I was first advised by Mr. Andrew Remes when he came&mdash;he had just
returned from the service ahead of me. He advised me that when he
was in the service, evidently, Mr. Huff, who had been left in charge of
the district, had permitted the entire district to collapse, because when
he came back from the service&mdash;I am speaking of Mr. Remes&mdash;he told
me there was not a single functioning branch of the Communist Party
in the entire district, that it took him several weeks to get together
the membership of any one branch. And he could only do it by legwork,
walking from house to house, to the old addresses of the people
he knew before he went into the service. And he was dumfounded
to find that condition existing.</p>

<p>When he had gone in the service the party numbered in the neighborhood
of 5,000 in this district.</p>

<p>In other words, it was baffling to us as to why that thing had
happened.</p>

<p>Later on I came to the conclusion that Mr. Huff was either representing
the Federal Bureau of Investigation or somebody else who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
was as opposed to the party as anybody could be because I couldn’t
account for any explanation for that development.</p>

<p>I soon found that I was running into a stone wall. Everything
I proposed by way of reorganization or by way of organizational
activities&mdash;I, for instance, felt that a fundamental policy of the party
was to concentrate in the mass production industries, to concentrate
in basic industries. I had always been taught that that was one of
the party’s chief concerns.</p>

<p>But, lo and behold, when I approached the district leaders asking
for assistance to concentrate on making a strong party in the steelworkers,
they said, “Oh, we’re not interested in them. We have got
other problems that are more important to us than just a bunch of
steelworkers.” Which was an attitude expressing to me a certain
contempt for the workers, which didn’t go very well because I have
the greatest respect for men who have the audacity to try to work for a
living. And I didn’t like this business of people who were sitting
up on top sneering, speaking about the membership in such a cursory
way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did the question of Communist Party activity in
veterans’ organizations come up at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes; it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Just touch on it very briefly, please, because we have
very little time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I was called to a fraction meeting of returned veterans
to try to work out some kind of veterans’ policy, and some of
these veterans reported boastfully that they had just walked into some
veterans’ posts and had captured the leadership&mdash;no trouble at all.</p>

<p>I chastised them for being so naive as to think that the Communists
could capture a veterans’ organization when the purpose of the veterans’
organization was to oppose the Communist Party. And I told
them they were foolish to undertake such a task and that they shouldn’t
embark upon that policy. They told me I was nuts and that they knew
what they were doing because they had the success of having captured
a post.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Time, however, proved that you were correct, did it
not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I think it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You said both you and your wife were disciplined
by the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>When I returned from the service it didn’t take very long before
rumor was circulated to the effect that I was alleged to be an FBI
agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Was your wife a member of the Communist Party,
too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I would like to say at this point that it is not the
practice of this committee, and it is not my practice to ask a witness
any questions relating to the activities of his wife. There have been
several occasions when witnesses felt that, in order to give the complete
story to the committee, it was necessary to speak of their wife’s
activities. But when they did, they did it on their own volition.
Therefore, I am not asking you any questions with regard to your wife.
If you mention her it is purely on your own volition.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. To explain this disciplinary action I have to advise
that my former wife and I were expelled from the party on the same
document with the same explanation, the same reasons. The documentary
evidence will bring her into this part of it.</p>

<p>And the account which I wish to make about the discipline against
her is of far more importance than the discipline against me, although
I am convinced that the purpose of the discipline was to get me out
of their hair.</p>

<p>It seems as though some people in the district leadership did not
like to be reminded of what the party policy used to be, and they
objected to my reminding them of the zigzags which they had followed
in the intervening period.</p>

<p>I was trying to find some way of bringing them to what I considered
to be the official party position, and they seemed to have an entirely
different attitude than I.</p>

<p>It resulted finally in a series of meetings with the district disciplinary
body known to me originally as a control commission. The last
I heard it was called a review commission. But, in effect, it amounts
to a kangaroo court because, in my case, they started out with this
rumor that I was an FBI agent, asked me to explain it, and all I could
do was explain that my former wife had done something which they
had authorized. And Mr. Huff admitted that he authorized it.</p>

<p>It is true that it ultimately led her to make certain reports which
did contribute to the war effort by way of eliminating bottlenecks
which she found in various parts of the war production industry.
But this had been approved by Mr. Huff.</p>

<p>And then when I was on the pan, Mr. Huff first admitted that he
had authorized her to engage in this activity, then later denied that
he had done so, and used the allegation that I was an FBI agent
as the excuse to cause my expulsion from the party, mainly and, in
my judgment, solely because I was in total disagreement with them
on policies relating to civil rights, policies relating to Veterans’ Administration
and veterans’ work, and policies relating to organization
in basic industry.</p>

<p>And the civil rights question was extremely important to me because
in the organization of civil rights struggles it was my conception
that if you are going to fight for civil rights you have to fight for
civil rights for everyone. And when we attempted to organize a
civil rights congress at the outset with that purpose in mind, and
that as our declared effort, we were advised that the Communist Party
could not afford to waste its time fighting for civil rights for everybody,
that they were only interested in fighting for civil rights for
members of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Is that one of the matters on which you disagreed
with the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. It certainly was. Mr. Andrew Remes advised me
personally that that was the situation, the party was in so much difficulty
that it had to restrict its efforts to the defense of the Communist
Party and that the Civil Rights Congress was created solely for that
purpose.</p>

<p>I ceased to have any interest in it whatsoever, and, as a consequence,
one thing led to another, and they finally expelled us with a notice on
the early week of October 1947.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. You were removed from the party then. Membership
was taken away from you for about the same reasons that you were
removed from the bureau, from the district bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. That was about 6 years before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Do you mean they spent all that time trying to change
your mind about civil rights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Well, there was an intervening period in which I was
away, you know. I was in the service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. There were several breaks there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I believe you were in the service from 1943 practically
through the year 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I do not want you to go into great detail, but I believe
the record should be a little clearer on the character of work in
which your wife was actually engaged, which you say was authorized
by the head of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. A stranger approached her and asked her if she
would submit reports to him about any bottlenecks that she found in
war production. He advised her that he had been informed that she
was a very well-informed person, knew a lot of people, and would be
capable of doing this work. She didn’t know what to make of it.
So she wrote to me while I was in the service asking my opinion,
and I told her to hold off until I got back on furlough.</p>

<p>At that time I suggested to her that she take it up with the district
leadership of the party, which she did, and got this approval.</p>

<p>The nature of that work she found&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That had nothing to do with reporting to any agency
of Communist Party activities as such?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. No; it did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. But it was just a matter of reporting things which
interfered with the war effort in industry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Among the things that she found, some of the outstanding things,
was one occasion pertaining to the Tacoma shipyards. She learned
by various sources&mdash;friends that she knew in the labor movement&mdash;that
the shipyard had been in operation for a period of around 10
months or more and still didn’t have a ship on the ways. She made
a number of inquiries as to how they could account for such a thing,
and at one point she ran across a name that rang a bell with her.</p>

<p>She started to do a little probing, and found out that this name was
the same as that of a person who had been removed from the navy yard
some time before, either 2 or 3 years before, maybe. It might have been
longer than that. But the person had been removed as a Fascist. He
was known to be a member of a Silver Shirt organization.</p>

<p>Lo and behold, this person turns up as the production supervisor or
superintendent in this particular shipyard.</p>

<p>Anyway, she submitted a report of all the information she had
gathered on the subject. Within a couple of weeks’ time this person
was removed from his position, and within a short time afterward
ships were on the ways in that shipyard and production started booming.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
We could only draw a conclusion that her information had, certainly,
some value.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. We will be very much interested to hear of other
occasions, but, because of the shortness of time, we will have to move
on.</p>

<p>The point is, that before undertaking that type of work your wife
conferred with the leadership of the Communist Party and obtained
approval.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Then take it up from there and tell us what occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That was part of the story on which this allegation
of FBI agent thing arose.</p>

<p>When I was first confronted with the story I recounted this whole
thing in every detail to the leader of the section. The person was Mr.
Jim Bourne. Mr. Jim Bourne told me to sit tight, do nothing, say
nothing until I heard from the district.</p>

<p>I waited from March until June 1947, and still had no word from
them. About sometime in June I was invited to a meeting which was
called by the Communist Party for the purpose of preparing its defenses
from the anticipated attack which would come from the Canwell
committee investigation which was about to open.</p>

<p>I reluctantly went to the meeting because I felt I was under a cloud.
However, I did go. I am glad I did because they did discuss the whole
question of these investigating committees, and it gave me some insight
as to my rights under the fifth amendment of the Constitution of the
United States. It was thoroughly discussed in this meeting, and we
understood that that was the sole and only real protection that a person
had if he wanted to avoid testifying.</p>

<p>However, during the course of that meeting I spoke to a leader of the
party, asking what was happening to my case. He advised me to speak
to Mr. Huff. I spoke to Mr. Huff about it and Mr. Huff, as a result of
it, arranged a meeting of the control commission.</p>

<p>The control commission called me to a meeting within a week’s time.
We reviewed the whole situation, the whole case, and I told them
every single thing I knew about it. They asked me to submit a
written statement. I did exactly that. I detailed everything that
I knew about the situation in the statement.</p>

<p>I declined to sign the statement, however, because at that time I
feared that their practices and methods were a little bit too loose,
and I feared it might fall into the wrong hands and be used against me.</p>

<p>However, they accepted the statement, but they did not like what
was in it.</p>

<p>They called me to another meeting, and at the second meeting
they upbraided me and accused me of everything under the sun,
and we finally broke up in rather a violent battle over whether or
not they were trying to help the working class or not.</p>

<p>That occurred some time in August.</p>

<p>By October Mr. John Lawrie, the chairman of the control commission,
visited our home, demanded our books, our party books.</p>

<p>We reluctantly gave them to him, protesting that we understood
that a person had a right to be charged and tried, hear witnesses, and
that sort of thing.</p>

<p>He said, “Well, you will get a statement.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span></p>

<p>About a week later we did receive a statement. The statement was
an expulsion notice from the Communist Party.</p>

<p>No charges had ever been actually preferred, no opportunity for
trial had been granted us, and we were blasphemed and accused of
everything under the sun which is looked upon as a crime by the
members of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>This statement was circulated to all the Communist Party sections,
and evidently it reached other hands, because shortly afterward some
security agencies of the Government called me up and asked me what
was going on. I told them I didn’t know, and I declined to talk
with any of them, and I have never talked to any of them except on
one occasion when Mr. John Boyd asked that I stop by the Immigration
Bureau Office.</p>

<p>I did stop by there. He asked me a number of questions then, and
I refused to be of any assistance to him whatsoever at that time.
That was shortly after the expulsion.</p>

<p>Now, the most important part of this disciplinary action is what
I have to say at this time, because immediately after receiving this
notice, we received rumors to the effect that the Communist Party
members in the union of which my former wife was the president,
which was the United Office and Professional Workers of America,
Local 35&mdash;I heard the rumor that they were going to come into that
meeting that night and demand her removal from the organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You mean that the union members were going to
demand&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I heard the Communist Party members in that union
were going to make a demand in that union that my former wife
be removed from office and be removed as a member of that union
because the party had disciplined her.</p>

<p>The situation in that union was very peculiar. It was a union of
about 65 members, and there were no more than a half-dozen persons
in it who were not members of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>That seems incredible, but the reason for it is that most of the
persons who were members of the union were working as secretaries
in various union offices, or were working for some individual employer
with whom there were no collective-bargaining contracts and there
were no regular functions of a union. It was simply a home where
these people could pay dues and use the union label wherever they
wanted to for their own convenience. As a matter of fact, that is the
reason why the Communist Party usually uses the union label on its
circulars or letters, because it has members in the Communist Party
office who were members of that union.</p>

<p>This particular expulsion drew the attention of the Communist
Party to us, and especially to my former wife. They knew that the
steelworkers union was bitterly anti-Communist. They didn’t dare
to try to make any approaches to the steelworkers union to have me
thrown out, but they did have absolute control, they thought, in the
office workers union, and they thought they would take their revenge
on my former wife by proceeding against her.</p>

<p>When I learned of this I went to the office of the party and asked
for the district leadership to give me an audience.</p>

<p>They treated me like scum under their feet when I went in their
office because I had just been expelled. However, I did speak to them
and advised them that I heard this rumor, that I urged them not to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
be as foolhardy as that because to do so would attract public attention.
And if that was done it would do irreparable harm to that union and
might also bring down a great deal of criticism on the entire labor
movement for something for which the labor movement itself was not
at fault but was something for which the Communist Party was at
fault.</p>

<p>I, therefore, asked them if they would be so considerate as to allow
my former wife to resign her position if it was inconvenient for them
to have her in that position.</p>

<p>She had no desire to remain in it any longer than necessary. She
thought she was rendering them a service and thought she was rendering
the union a service by holding that position.</p>

<p>But they said they would not take their advice from expelled members.</p>

<p>So they proceeded that night to introduce a mimeographed proposal
preferring charges against my former wife.</p>

<p>Now I have borrowed this from a person who has kept the file because
he was prevailed upon by my former wife and myself to act
as her counsel during the course of that proceeding, and he kept a
complete file.</p>

<p>I have here the original of the charges that were preferred against
her, and the substance of it is simply this: That they were asking for
my former wife to be expelled from that union and from the office
of president in that union simply because she had been expelled from
the Communist Party on a kangaroo court proceeding. And the names
of the signers are here and in their own original handwriting. Some of
them have been called before this committee before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Is that for expulsion from the United Office and Professional
Workers Union or from the party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. No. This is the charges that were preferred in the
Office Workers Union by members of the Office Workers Union who
were also&mdash;they must have been members of the Communist Party.
I didn’t know of them of my own knowledge, but my former wife did,
and it is in their handwriting. Their names are there in their own
handwriting. And I think the committee would like to know this
and have this as a matter of record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you read the names into the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. If you are sure that they are all members of the party.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. My counsel raised the same question, Mr. Tavenner,
that inasmuch as I cannot testify of my own knowledge about their
membership, that perhaps it is not proper for me. However, this is
the document which was used in that union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Let me ask you a few preliminary questions.</p>

<p>Were you given a written notice of expulsion by the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes, we were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Can you identify language in that expulsion notice
as being virtually the same language as in the notice of charges given
by the union to your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. It certainly is. In both instances they accuse her
of the crime of being an informer for the FBI.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. We will not take time now to analyze those documents,
but I would like for them to be in evidence, and, in light of the
fact that the names signed have not been shown by evidence to be
members of the Communist Party, I ask that that part of the document
be deleted until investigation has established whether or not
they are members of the party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. As requested by counsel, without objection, it is so
ordered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I would like for the document to be marked “Dennett
Exhibit No. 10.”</p>

<p>(The document above referred to, marked “Dennett Exhibit No. 10,”
is filed herewith.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dennett Exhibit No. 10</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>We, the undersigned, prefer charges against Harriette Dennett, President,
United Office and Professional Workers of America, Local 35, for violation of the
Constitution of the National Union under the following Articles:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article II</span>, Section 3. “No person whose interests are deemed to lie with the
employer as against the employees shall be eligible for membership.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article II</span>, Section 5, Obligations of Members. “... to bear true allegiance
to, and keep inviolate the principles of the union; ... and to promote the interests
of our members in harmony with the best interests of our country.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article VI</span>, Section 9, Obligations of Local Union Officers. “... to perform
all your duties as required by the laws of the Union and the instruction of the
membership ... and that you will do everything in your power to forward the
interests of the organized labor movement.”</p>

<p>We have certain evidence clearly revealing that Harriette Dennett has made
regular reports to the Federal Bureau of Investigation over a long period of time
for which she has received payment. We are convinced that no honest trade
unionist would have connections with any police body, especially the FBI, and
still serve the best interests of the Union.</p>

<p>Let as examine the role of the FBI. Organized labor recognizes that law
enforcing agencies are absolutely necessary in the protection of public and private
property, prevention of crime, and safeguarding our welfare. However, various
police bodies, both Federal and local, have always allied themselves with the
employers in economic struggles. In strikes, the U. S. Army and National
Guard have smashed picket lines and arrested union leaders, and, in conjunction
with the courts, have framed them, had them imprisoned, deported, and even
executed.</p>

<p>The FBI especially, acting as the undercover arm of these police forces, while
it has done a commendable job in the apprehension of criminals, has constantly
used its prestige and power in aiding employers and local police agencies in their
efforts to weaken and destroy unions by hunting down progressive and militant
trade unionists and having them blacklisted from their jobs.</p>

<p>In the Bridges Case, witnesses were either paid or intimidated by the FBI to
testify falsely. They did not hesitate to use wiretapping, dictographing, and
other devices, although illegal. At the present time, John Santos, long-time
leader of the Transport Workers Union, is undergoing an ordeal very similar to
that of Bridges. Strenuous efforts are being made to deport him because he has
earned the enmity of powerful transit and utility corporations. He is charged
with being an alien “red.” And, once again, the FBI is playing a key role in
this hearing by rounding up questionable anti-labor characters to testify against
him.</p>

<p>According to the La Follette Civil Liberties Committee, the Pinkerton Detective
Agency was found to have 300 operatives enrolled in unions as members,
<i>of whom at least 100 were union officials</i>&mdash;of them 14 presidents of locals, one
national vice-president, 14 trustees, and 20 local union secretaries.</p>

<p>We are at present witnessing an attack upon a union in our own city as a
result of the combination of discredited labor leaders, the un-American Canwell
Committee and the Seattle P-I and its FBI agent and strike-breaker, Fred
Niendorff.</p>

<p>Today, Labor is faced with and all-out offensive of the profit-greedy NAM.
They are determined to bring wages down while continuing to raise the cost of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
living. This attack on the peoples’ living standards is most serious to the thousands
of greatly underpaid white-collar workers.</p>

<p>To accomplish this union-busting program, the most vicious antilabor legislation,
such as the Taft-Hartley law has been passed, and the Un-American Activities
Committee, the little Dies Committees and numerous other government
agencies&mdash;all in conjunction with the FBI&mdash;are engaged in a witch-hunt against
labor.</p>

<p>Let us recall that it was not until trade unions were made impotent in Germany
that Hitler dared to embark on the road to concentration and extermination
camps.</p>

<p>The National CIO has condemned the Department of Justice for conducting a
“gumshoe” probe of CIO political expenditures. President Philip Murray has
reported “furtive operations and dramatic unearthing of clues by the FBI ...
which can have only the objective of harassing and intimidation.”</p>

<p>Anyone working with the FBI or with any of the above-named antilabor
committees or against the best interests of the union must clearly be labeled an
enemy of labor and removed from membership in any labor organization to which
he may belong.</p>

<p>Therefore, in pursuance of the procedure established by Section I, ARTICLE XV,
which states that any elective or appointive officers of a local union may be
removed from office subject to provisions of this Article for any violation of this
Constitution “or because of the commission of an act impairing the usefulness
of the organization,” we are presenting these charges, and demanding the expulsion
of Harriette Dennett from UOPWA 35. We call upon our Union to immediately
set up a trial committee to investigate these charges and report back its
findings to a special membership meeting to be called for action by the membership.</p>

<p>uopwa 35 cio</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And I would like also to introduce in evidence at
this time the expulsion notice that was given you, and ask that it be
marked “Dennett Exhibit No. 11.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. As requested by counsel, without objection, it is so
ordered.</p>

<p>(The document above referred to, marked “Dennett Exhibit No. 11,”
is filed herewith).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dennett Exhibit</span> No. 11</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Notice of Expulsion</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
To All Sections, Clubs, and Members of the<br />
<span class="i4">Northwest District Communist Party, U. S. A.:</span></p>

<p>This is to notify all Sections and Clubs of the expulsion from the Communist
Party of Eugene V. Dennett, Harriet Dennett, and Claude Smith.</p>

<p>In the case of Eugene Dennett and Harriet Dennett, the expulsion is based upon
violation of the conditions of membership in the Communist Party as set
forth in Article 9, Sections 1, 2, and 4 of the Constitution of the Communist
Party, U. S. A., based upon the following facts established by the District
Review Commission:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Admitted employment of Harriet Dennett by an agency of the F. B. I.
and the submitting of regular reports to said agency over a long period of
time, with the knowledge and consent, and direct participation of Eugene
V. Dennett. This was established by his admission of personal contact with
a known agent of the F. B. I. and his concealment from the Party of Harriet
Dennett’s activities and his own personal contact with the F. B. I.</p>

<p>2. Admitted personal and political relations by Eugene V. Dennett with
known Trotskyites with established participation by Harriet Dennett.</p>

<p>3. An established record of anti-party, disruptive, and provocative activity
by Eugene Dennett on numerous occasions and by Harriet Dennett in
several instances.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the case of Claude Smith, the expulsion is based upon violation of the
conditions of membership in the Communist Party as set forth in Article 9,
Sections 1, 2, and 4 of the Constitution of the Communist Party, U. S. A., and
based upon the following facts established by the District Review Commission:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Admitted participation in the preparation of the reports submitted by
Harriet Dennett to the Agency referred to above as well as sharing in the
payment for those reports and concealment of these activities from the
Party.</p></blockquote>

<p>The District Review Commission wishes to call to the attention of the Party
membership and its organizations the necessary conclusions from these facts.
First, in this case as in many in the past, a negative, carping attitude toward
the Party and its program has upon investigation disclosed enemies of the Party
and the working class.</p>

<p>The same thing must be said of toleration and association with Trotskyites who
are simply fascists hiding behind “left” phrases. While such attitudes may be
due to lack of understanding in new members, in the case of experienced long
time members it can only be regarded as conscious assistance to fascism and
to the agents of fascism. It must be noted also that the personal record of these
people is marked by individualism instability and extreme egotism.</p>

<p>The District Review Commission also wishes to point out that it is necessary
to learn to distinguish between honest differences of opinion which we have to
constantly resolve by discussion and majority decision and disruptive, dishonest
attacks upon the program activities and leadership of the Party, which
is the earmark of the provocateur and agent of the enemy. Only by more
resolutely defending and fighting for the program of the Party can we make
this distinction clear. Only by becoming more alert to the smell of anti-Party
poison can we root out these disrupters. Only by fighting for the unity of the
Party and testing our cadres struggle can we create guarantees that such
elements will not remain long in the Party or be able to steal into its posts
of leadership, and that the damage that they do will be reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>Harriet Dennett is at present holding the position of President of the Seattle
UOPWA Local Union No. 35. Eugene Dennett is a member of the Board of
Control of the NEW WORLD and a member of the Steelworkers Union. Claude
Smith is at present editor of the Washington State CIO news.</p>

<p>All Party members are warned against personal or political association with
these expelled members and to give them no consideration or comfort in the
excuses and protests they can be expected to make against the expulsion action
which was ordered carried out by unanimous vote of the Northwest District
Committee in executive session on October 6, 1947.</p>

<p>uopwa No. 35.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. There is one question I would like to ask you, Mr. Dennett,
about your expulsion and your wife’s. You probably recall the
argument that took place within the ranks of the Communist Party
during the change from the Communist political association to the
militant type of organization it was before.</p>

<p>Did you or your wife engage in any of those arguments after the
receipt of the Duclos letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes, we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I am interested in that, if you will please be as brief as
you can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I will do my best, sir.</p>

<p>I was still in the service at the time. This occurred in New Orleans.
My wife was still doing this same work in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Was that in the middle of 1945?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is right, in May and June of 1945.</p>

<p>And with the publication of the Duclos letter in the Daily Worker,
which my wife was a subscriber to at that time, we observed that
something tremendous was taking place within the party. And she
made contact with some of the party people in New Orleans.</p>

<p>When they found that we had an interest in it, they invited us to
the meetings where this discussion took place. And I was quite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
startled to find that the general criticism was mainly directed at the
bureaucratic attitude and dictatorial policies pursued by Mr. Earl
Browder. I was flabbergasted because I did not have that conception
of him, and I was quite surprised as a result of it. And, of course,
you know the rest of the story, which was published.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. In other words, you and your wife both took the side
of Earl Browder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I wouldn’t say that my former wife took the side of
Earl Browder. I wouldn’t say I took the side of Earl Browder
either because I was not in the party at the time. I was simply a
visitor invited, and I was mainly surprised. I questioned the reports
that people made. I didn’t pass judgment on it. I simply
could hardly believe the criticism which I heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. It appears to me from your testimony that you were
probably sort of independent in this matter of following the Communist
Party line as handed down from Soviet Russia, and that was probably
one of the chief reasons why you were expelled. Is that not
right? You would not follow the party line? You thought for
yourself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I thought I was following the party line, and I
thought the leaders around here were zigzagging all over the lot, and
they didn’t know what the line was. They thought I was nuts. I
thought they were nuts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Maybe you were just like Trotsky or Lovestone. You
just didn’t happen to be in the ruling class as far as the party line
was concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, we have just checked the names
on exhibit No. 10, and find that all of the persons whose names appear
there have been identified in testimony before this committee
as Communist Party members. Therefore, I see no reason for restricting
that document in any way in its introduction in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. It is so ordered. Do you wish to read the names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I desire the witness to read the names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Alice Kinney, known to me before as Alice Balmer,
B-a-l-m-e-r; Trudi Kirkwood, Helen Huff. Helen Huff was known
to me as the wife of Henry Huff, who was the district organizer of
the party, and Helen Huff was one of those persons to whom I spoke
when I requested that they allow my former wife to resign, but they
would have nothing to do with that. They wouldn’t allow it. They

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Dennett, are there any other facts relating to
your expulsion which would be of interest to this committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I think, Mr. Tavenner and members of the committee,
that there are probably many. But, in view of the pressing
time, I think that this is sufficient to give you the picture, and, if you
want to go into more detail at a later time when you have more time
available, I think maybe we could do that. I have said all I think I
need to say at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. After your expulsion have you been identified with
the Communist Party in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The committee had information indicating that you
may possibly have become a member after your expulsion, or even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
prior to that, of the Socialist Workers Party. And the information
that the committee had in that respect was a nominating petition of
that group signed by you.</p>

<p>We would like to know whether you were at any time a member of
the Socialist Workers Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. The answer is very simple. I was not. I never have
been a member of the Socialist Workers Party.</p>

<p>The occasion for that signature on that nominating petition is the
result of a request from the Socialist Workers Party leader, Mr.
Daniel Roberts, who was the leader at that time, that I sign a nominating
petition to permit their candidates to get on the ballot.</p>

<p>In the State of Washington a provision is in the election laws
allowing nominating petitions to be signed by a minimum of 25 people
who are qualified voters who did not vote in the primary. In other
words, it is equivalent to casting a vote.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did the Socialist Workers Party endeavor to recruit
you as a member?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes. Mr. Daniel Roberts tried time and time again
to recruit me, thinking that my vast experience in the Communist
Party gave me plenty of background to qualify me if I would simply
change my thinking with respect to certain fundamental ideas which
were points of difference between the Socialist Workers Party and the
Communist Party. However, I never was able to accept all of the
ideas which Mr. Roberts and some of their national leaders to whom
he introduced me&mdash;I could never resolve all of the policies which they
advocated to my own thinking.</p>

<p>And the whole experience caused me to go back and question and
challenge the validity of the theoretical basis upon which the Communist
Party was organized and upon which it operated. And it caused
me to reach the conclusion a long time ago that it is very inadvisable
for anyone to commit his political fealty to anyone or any organization
that he doesn’t understand in full. And I do not to this day completely
understand the Socialist Workers Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I noticed in some of the earlier documents introduced
in evidence that reference was made to you when the Communist
Party was critical of you as being a Trotskyite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is true. Remarks were made about me on a
number of occasions. And, as near as I can make out, the reason for
it is I was asking embarrassing questions. It seems as though Trotsky
did that against Mr. Stalin in the Soviet Union&mdash;when everyone
especially was interested in a democratic procedure that went contrary
to Stalin’s rule. His rule was that you had to accept his decision
whether you liked it or not. And that is the rule of democratic
centralism, a principle with which I am in total disagreement today.
I thought for a long time that that was a wonderful principle. I had
read Lenin’s writings on the subject. I thought that his explanations
were quite good. But once I had had service in the military, once
I knew what military organization was like, I recognized the principle
of democratic centralism as the application of military rule to civilian
life. And I am strictly opposed to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In light of your experience in the Communist Party,
and from your study of the Socialist Workers Party, would you please
state as briefly as you can the principal differences between these
organizations as you understood them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. One of the principal differences lies in the fact that
the Socialist Workers Party people accused the Communist Party
people, in particular Stalin and Stalinism, of having deserted the
principle of socialism, of internationalism, accusing Stalin of degenerating
into nationalism. That is when he developed the so-called
theory of the possibility of developing socialism in one country alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That country being the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That country being the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>The Trotskyites maintained that Stalin was thereby deserting the
cause of internationalism and that he would think first of the interests
of the Soviet Union, and later, if at all, subordinate the interests
of the world working class to building the Soviet Union at the
cost of letting the working class in other countries go by the boards.</p>

<p>In other words, if a revolutionary situation developed in some other
country Stalin would exert his power to prevent the success of the
revolution in that country for fear that it would detract from the
success of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Unless, of course, such a revolution would
strengthen his power and his regime in the Soviet Union. Wouldn’t
you make that qualification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That might be a consideration. But all history, all
experience since the Second World War would indicate that Stalin
at no time approved successful revolutions in any country. He opposed
revolutionary effort of the Yugoslavs. He opposed the revolutionary
effort of the Communists in Greece. He opposed the revolutionary
effort of the Chinese Communists. He even made commitments,
and part of the deal which people seemed to be so concerned
about at Yalta and Potsdam and Cairo and Casablanca involved Stalin
making commitments to Roosevelt and Churchill to the effect that the
Soviet Union would use its influence to suppress the revolutionary
effort of the workers in the various countries that were on the brink
of revolution.</p>

<p>And that is why when the Soviet Red Army marched into those
border countries in eastern Europe they did not attempt to create a
Soviet revolution. They, instead, created something they called people’s
democracies. But they were established in some instances with
the aid of the Red army marching in, and the people in those countries
had nothing to say about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the attitude of the Trotskyites as to Stalin’s
agreement with reference to Greece, for instance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. They accused him of betraying the working class
not only in Greece but in the Soviet Union because he was ruling in
the Soviet Union with such an iron hand that workers there were being
suppressed. They were being forbidden from enjoying the efforts
they were putting in to build a Socialist country. In fact, they were
being deprived of the fruits of what was intended to be socialism. In
fact, the Trotskyites, as I understand, their philosophy in the matter
is that the Soviet Union has suffered from an arrested development&mdash;it
is not truly Socialist; it has not been permitted to become Socialist,
and that the biggest crime Stalin committed was to pretend and hold
the Soviet Union up to world view as a Socialist country when, in fact,
it was not a Socialist country.</p>

<p>I also came to the conclusion, as a result of some of the theoretical
material I read in about 1946, where Stalin was insisting that, instead
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
of the authority of the state withering away as predicted in
the writings of Engels and Lenin, that Stalin insisted that the authority
of the state must increase, that the police power must be increased
in the Soviet Union to make sure that they would continue
in an ordered fashion, which certainly was contrary to all the earlier
writings on the theoretical subject of the development of the state.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It has been demonstrated time and again, has it not,
to your satisfaction, that Stalin has endeavored to use international
communism as a tool in order to advance his own foreign policy which
necessarily, of course, meant his strengthening his own position in
the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. It certainly is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. There are many other matters that I would have
liked to have gone into with you, but I must terminate the examination.
I do not like to do so without giving you an opportunity to
state anything that may be in your mind about the effect of your
experience in the Communist Party or your present attitude toward
the Communist Party.</p>

<p>I am not insisting that you do, but I merely want to give you the
opportunity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. My counsel has already advised me to be very brief.
I am very appreciative of the suggestion because the hour is late, and
I want to thank you for the opportunity you have given me to make a
statement.</p>

<p>The only statement I would make at this time is some elaboration
over what I started to say earlier when we were talking about what
steps to take to protect yourself against this sort of deception.</p>

<p>I am sure that some people in hearing the account which I have
given by way of testimony before this committee may gather the
impression that I learned quite a little bit about deception. And I
am sure that some people were quite firmly convinced that I would
do nothing except deceive this committee when I appeared before it.</p>

<p>I wish to assure you that I have testified to the best of my ability
about the facts that I know and facts which I can substantiate with
documentary evidence in my own records.</p>

<p>Those records are available to the committee. They have been made
available to the committee, and I understand that you intend to have
the United States Marshal pick them up and place them in protective
custody where they will be available for me for further study and
also to yourself.</p>

<p>I simply recite that as some indication that in my testifying before
you the only reservation that I have is that I still have some misgivings
about this kind of procedure because I fear that we are
needlessly hurting individuals when we name them in such vast numbers
as the committee has called upon me to do.</p>

<p>I think that some means needs to be found to change that procedure.
And I believe that there will be more information of value to convincing
the general public and to assisting the Congress, by way of its
legislative effort, if a better effort is found.</p>

<p>And I hope that you will seriously pay attention to the recommendations
of the American Civil Liberties Union in this regard. I think
their recommendations deserve your worthy consideration.</p>

<p>I think, gentlemen, that is about all that is needed for me to say at
this time. I can only say that I am available for whatever further
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
work that you wish to do with me. I do not want anyone to think
that they are going to make a professional witness out of me. I
have no intention of being a professional witness. I would like to be
able to live in peace and quiet because my own health will not permit
me to do all the other things that need to be done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Mr. Dennett, as chairman of this committee, and on
behalf of counsel, Mr. Tavenner, and Mr. Wheeler, and I believe I
should presume to express appreciation also on behalf of the full committee
on Un-American Activities, the Congress of the United States,
and the people of America for your honest, courageous, patriotic, and
convincing testimony and information concerning communistic
activities.</p>

<p>Your comprehensive and intelligent testimony is not only revealing
but has been ably presented by you in a patriotic and conscientious
spirit and duty to your country and also to yourself.</p>

<p>We commend you for your appearance and conduct before this committee
as an example&mdash;and I emphasize this&mdash;as an example of how
any and all former Communist Party members can clear themselves
of any doubt whatsoever concerning their loyalty to the United States
of America.</p>

<p>And, speaking for myself, I am glad I had an opportunity to observe
your conduct on the witness stand, and, having heard your testimony,
I am deeply impressed by the valuable information you have given to
the committee.</p>

<p>Mr. Velde, do you have anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Yes, Mr. Chairman. I don’t think I can add too much
to your very fine statement.</p>

<p>Let me say that I concur with our distinguished friend from Missouri
in his statement about your testimony.</p>

<p>I happened to be here last year when you refused to testify. I think
I mentioned earlier&mdash;last Thursday&mdash;that you would have a lot more
friends after you got through testifying than you had before or during
the time that you appeared here last time, and I sincerely hope
that that is true. I believe it will be.</p>

<p>The reason, of course, that we were not able to hear your testimony
at the sessions here last June was that we had too many other witnesses
subpenaed to be heard as we do apparently this time, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Let me say that I think you have made a great addition to the
information that is already on file concerning the activities of the
Communist Party. But, chiefly, you have made a great contribution
in substantiating, in large part, the testimony that was given by Mrs.
Barbara Hartle and other witnesses who gave information here last
June. For that we are very appreciative.</p>

<p>I want to say just a word about Mrs. Hartle.</p>

<p>As you know, she is presently serving in the prison in West Virginia,
a Federal penitentiary in West Virginia.</p>

<p>I think she certainly exhibited a great deal of courage and a great
deal of American spirit in giving the testimony that she did.</p>

<p>Mr. Dennett, as far as the particular testimony you have given
about your expulsion from the Communist Party is concerned, the
experience that you had is similar to the experience of other persons
who have been expelled from the Communist Party.</p>

<p>I think, of course, that you should be proud to have been expelled
by the Communist Party. And I trust that, while you might at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
times find yourself in the same position of following the same line
that the Communist Party does at the present time, that you no longer
cling to the philosophy that we know the Communist Party represents
here in the United States, that is, the philosophy of the Soviet
Union, which intends of course, to rule the world eventually, whether
it be by changing governments by peaceful means or by overthrowing
it by force and violence.</p>

<p>We say it has been a great pleasure to hear your very fine testimony,
and let me say also that I agree that you have been a very intelligent
and truthful witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. With our thanks and gratitude, you are excused.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>I wish to say, upon my being excused, that I want to extend my
greatest appreciation to the patience of Mr. Tavenner, who has been
the counsel to examine me. It has been a pleasure to work with a
gentleman who is as well versed and who knows what he is doing
as well as Mr. Tavenner.</p>

<p>And I want to thank Mr. Wheeler for the patience that he had, and
the committee as well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Call the next witness, Mr. Tavenner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Abraham Cohen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Hold up your right hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Photographer, when you take your picture, would you stand
to the right or left so I can swear the witness.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give
before this congressional committee will be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cohen</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henry</span>. Edward Henry, of the Seattle bar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am not going to take the time to ask you various
questions which I know the committee is interested in asking you
because of the lateness of the hour. I will confine my questions to
just 2 or 3 matters. Are you now a member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cohen</span>. I am not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Have you ever been a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cohen</span>. I have been.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Over what period of time were you a member of
the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cohen</span>. From early in&mdash;well, I believe July 1937 until I left
for the Armed Forces in March of 1942, and then upon returning
from the war, oh, some time early in 1946, I would say, until January
1, 1951.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Have you been a member of the Communist Party
since 1951?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cohen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I believe you are one of the few, if not the only
person in the United States, who registered as a member of the Communist
Party upon the adoption of the Internal Security Act of 1950.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cohen</span>. It wasn’t a thing of which I was ashamed. I felt I
was in the party. I felt that what I was doing was the right thing.
I had no conscientious qualms about belonging to it. I felt what we
were doing was right. And everything that I saw&mdash;nothing I saw
led me to believe that it was subversive. I felt it was&mdash;what we were
doing was in the interest of the workingman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Our purpose in subpenaing you was to ask you
certain facts we think are within your knowledge regarding Communist
Party activities. You have indicated a full desire, a willingness
to give the committee the facts that you have. You have given a
a written statement to the staff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cohen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am not going into any of those matters now
because they are here available for us. But, out of fairness to you,
I want to give you the opportunity to make any further statement
you desire regarding your own attitude toward the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cohen</span>. Do you feel that I haven’t stated my position enough
in that brief?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. We would ask you additional questions if we had
time to do it, and we may do that later. But for the present I want
to be certain you have an opportunity to tell the committee anything
further that is on your mind that might be of some benefit to yourself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cohen</span>. Well, I felt that my desires on leaving the party were
that I was in it primarily because of its connection with the trade-union
movement. It helped the Guild in the early days to organize.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And you function within the American Newspaper
Guild?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cohen</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>I felt it did a worthwhile job there. And a great many people&mdash;Communists
and non-Communists&mdash;benefited thereby. After the war
the situation changed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The witness is excused.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am not sure that he is through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cohen</span>. I am ready to quit talking at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. This is your time to talk if you want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cohen</span>. After the war I felt that we were in a&mdash;we were extending
the neighborhood branches, and that the trade union, the
time for trade union action was past. We didn’t function in trade
union matters. My working hours were changed, and I no longer
was&mdash;I rarely attended meetings. I really lost what contact I had.</p>

<p>And the act that finally culminated in my leaving was the fact that
I wanted to take a trip abroad, and under one of the provisions of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
the McCarran Act it required that no Communist should be granted
a passport.</p>

<p>And so I wanted to visit scenes of where I had been during the war,
and I explained to the party that I wanted to leave. And it startled
them, I admit, reasonably. But I succeeded in resigning. And there
have been no repercussions since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Do I understand you have been, and are willing at any
time to make available any information you have relative to your
activities in the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cohen</span>. Yes, I am. I will say&mdash;before anybody even talks to
me&mdash;there weren’t very many. There were very few; there weren’t
very many.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. But are you willing to make those available to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cohen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. And, of course, we would be willing to hear you at
length if we had the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In light of the witness’ statements, I have no further
questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you have any further statement you wish to
make, Mr. Witness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cohen</span>. Nothing further to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Then you are excused as a witness.</p>

<p>(Whereupon the witness was excused.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. I was born in Seattle in 1893.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. I am not employed by anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you tell the committee, briefly, what your formal
educational training has been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freed</span>. I went through the public-school system, high school of
this city, and University of Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. When did you complete your educational training
at the University of Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. It was about the year 1930.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you tell the committee, please, how you have
been employed since 1935?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. I had no regular employment until the outbreak of
the war, and I worked in various war plants until I was incapacitated
by an accident in 1943.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was your business between 1930 and the outbreak
of the war?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. Well, I was unemployed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. During that entire period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. Practically, as I recollect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you engaged in any work of any kind during
that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. Well, there was no work available that I could find.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you mean you were unemployed until 1941,
December 1941?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Where did you live in 1940?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. I lived in Seattle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you engage in any work without remuneration?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. No.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. During the period from 1935 to 1940?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you connected with the Civil Rights Congress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. I think I should invoke the fifth amendment on that
question as I feel that it may tend to incriminate me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. To clarify the response, do you decline to answer by
invoking the fifth amendment of the Constitution, or do you refuse to
answer for fear it will tend to incriminate you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. And also the first amendment, which guarantees freedom
of speech and of the press and the right of people to assemble
peaceably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The witness who preceded you a few moments ago,
Mr. Eugene V. Dennett, described his disagreement with the Communist
Party in connection with its policy toward the Civil Rights
Congress. He told the committee that the Communist Party had
organized the Civil Rights Congress, but that he disagreed with the
policy of forming an organization which would defend only Communists.
And, for that reason, he incurred the wrath of his superiors
in the Communist Party.</p>

<p>He further testified that he was told by the leadership of the Communist
Party that it didn’t have time to protect the civil rights of
people generally, but it was only interested in the civil rights of members
of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Now it is our information that you held an official position in the
Civil Rights Congress. I may be wrong about that. But surely you
were in a position to know whether or not Mr. Dennett was telling the
truth about the attitude of the Communist Party toward the Civil
Rights Congress or the work of the Civil Rights Congress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. I should like to confer with my attorney.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. I invoke the first amendment and the fifth amendment
for the reasons previously stated. And I may add that I am pleased
to notice that there has been very widespread doubt expressed prominently
in the press about the veracity of a witness testifying before
this committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. If you have any doubt about that you are now in a
position to straighten the committee out on it. In what particular,
if any, was Mr. Dennett in error in his testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. I would like to confer with my counsel.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. I claim, again, the first and fifth amendments of the
Constitution, and I wish to add that I am reluctant to answer any
questions which would require me to claim the protection of the first
and fifth amendments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Are you now a member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. The answer is the same, for the same reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Have you ever been a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freyd</span>. The answer is the same, and for the same reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Any questions, Mr. Velde?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. No questions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The witness is excused.</p>

<p>(Whereupon the witness was excused.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Call the next witness, Mr. Tavenner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatten</span>. Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatten</span>. While I am here may I address the Chair with reference
to the O’Connell matter again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Yes.</p>

<h3>STATEMENT OF C. T. HATTEN, ATTORNEY AT LAW,
SEATTLE, WASH.</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatten</span>. I notice that on a number of witnesses the subpenas
have been continued, and I would like to formally move that the subpena
in case of Jerry O’Connell be continued to some later date at
which time his health might be better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The committee cannot entertain your motion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatten</span>. I merely would like to make it for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. You have made the request on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatten</span>. To state the position, I understand that possibly
you cannot pass upon it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Call the next witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Lenus Westman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you
are about to give before this congressional committee will be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I do.</p>

<h3 id="Hans_Lenus_Adolph_Westman495">TESTIMONY OF HANS LENUS ADOLPH WESTMAN, ACCOMPANIED
BY HIS COUNSEL, C. T. HATTEN</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Mr. Chairman, under the first and fifth amendments&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You haven’t been asked any questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. O. K.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. We will give you a chance.</p>

<p>What is your name, please, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Under the first and fifth amendments, as the result
of having been subpenaed, I wish to apply these two amendments as
reasons for not giving my name.</p>

<p>And also, in the light of the statement that was made here this afternoon,
that you would like to have some witness that didn’t have to use
his name, that is, that you could have appearing before you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You are mistaken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. We will have order, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Do you refuse to answer as to what your name is?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I am going to confer with my attorney.</p>

<p>I wish to state that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. You are directed to answer the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I will answer the question under protest.</p>

<p>My name is Hans Lenus Adolph Westman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you spell your last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. W-e-s-t-m-a-n.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It is noted that you are accompanied by counsel.</p>

<p>Will counsel please identify himself for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatten</span>. C. T. Hatten, previously identified as an attorney in
Seattle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Where do you live, Mr. Westman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. In Seattle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I would like to confer with counsel.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Well, I will answer under compulsion, and I am
a sheetmetal worker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you have any other occupation?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Do you mean at the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. During the last month, say, during the month of
March.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I would like to confer with my counsel.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Well, sir, I would like&mdash;I will decline to answer that
question under the fifth amendment, as I do not know what is referred
to as work by the question, and, hence, it might be something that is
construed by you, sir, as constituting work that might be of a character
that would waive my rights under the fifth amendment. And, hence,
I will take the fifth amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I will be more specific.</p>

<p>Have you been engaged during the month of March in any publication
work of any kind? That will limit it within narrow bounds.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I will decline to answer that under the fifth amendment.
And I would like to go into the reasons why I take the fifth
amendment, because under&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, the witness has stated his reason
as being the fifth amendment, which is a ground, under the circumstances
here, I think he is entitled to use. And, therefore, it would
not require any speech to accompany it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Please make a direct answer to the question. We will
get along more quickly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I said that under the fifth amendment I decline to
answer that question, and I would like to just point out, Mr. Chairman,
that I do take the fifth amendment because of the fact that it is in the
Constitution to protect the innocent, and for the same reason that you
gentlemen of Congress have congressional immunity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. You have made yourself clear about the fifth amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Have you at any time, during the month of March
1955, been the press director of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I will decline to answer that under the first and
fifth amendments, as, under the first amendment, that is directly inquiring
into the freedom of the press and into matters of like nature,
and, under the fifth amendment, I decline because such testimony
might be construed as testimony against myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mrs. Barbara Hartle testified before this committee,
in June of 1954. In the course of her testimony in identifying various
individuals as members of the Communist Party, she stated:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lenus Westman was a member of a club in the central region and lived in
that area. Most of his Communist Party activities were in mass work at that
time, like the Progressive Party or election work.</p></blockquote>

<p>Tell the committee, please, what knowledge you have of the activities
of the Communist Party, if any, within the Progressive Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Well, Mr. Chairman, I will decline to answer that
question under the fifth amendment.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I think I have made my point clear on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. May I ask you a question?</p>

<p>Where were you born and reared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I was born in Sweden, Umea, Sweden; and came
to this country at the age of 7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. How old are you now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I am 52 years of age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Are you a citizen of the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Yes, I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. How long have you been a citizen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Since 1936.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Have you served in the armed services of the United
States?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. What branch of the armed services?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. In the infantry, Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. For what period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. From July 1942, until February 1943.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Did you receive an honorable discharge from the
service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I would like to ask one question.</p>

<p>How did you obtain citizenship in this country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Through naturalization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did you file your petition for naturalization on your
own?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. It was by petition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the date of your naturalization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. It was July 1936.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was it July 27, 1936?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Yes; I think that was the exact date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Where were you naturalized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Here in Seattle in the Federal court.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you a member of the Communist Party at
the time you were naturalized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I decline to answer that question under the fifth
amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Are you a member of the Communist Party now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I decline to answer that question for the same reasons
that I have given.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Have you been a member of the Communist Party
at any time between 1936 and the present date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I decline to answer that question for the same reason
that I have given.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Were you a member of the Communist Party at the
time you were naturalized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I decline to answer that question also, and for the
same reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Mr. Chairman, it appears to me there is some evidence
that should be referred to the United States Immigration and Naturalization
Service for future consideration, possibly with a view to
denaturalization and deportation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you elected to the Senate of the State of
Washington in the election of 1940?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you serve? That is, were you seated?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I decline to answer that question, sir, under the
fifth amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I want to go a little further. When did you file your
petition for naturalization?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Well, at the moment I don’t recall exactly when I
filed the petition, but it is a matter of public record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Would it have been approximately 5 years before the
date of your naturalization in 1936?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Probably in 1931?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. It would be approximately in that period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. How old were you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I was 29, I believe, at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Then during the 5 years following your filing of a petition
for naturalization did you engage in any type of Communist
activity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I decline to answer that question for the reasons
that I have given before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did you know what the Communist Party was at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I decline to answer that question for the same reasons
that I have given.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Where, and in what court did you receive your citizenship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. It was at the Federal courthouse here, but I am not
sure at the present time which court it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. At the time that you received your citizenship in the
court, United States district court, were you engaged in any Communist
Party activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I decline to answer that question for the same reasons
that I have given before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Have you, to your own best knowledge and information,
ever committed any act, a subversive act or one of un-American
conduct against the United States of America?</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Well, sir, under the fifth amendment, I must decline
to answer that question, and I also know that this committee knows
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
that I have not been engaged in such activities. I am sure that this
committee knows that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. As a member of the committee, I certainly do not know
that you have not been engaged in subversive activities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. It seems to me you now have an opportunity to tell
the committee that you have not been engaged in subversive activities.</p>

<p>(The witness confers with his counsel.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. I still decline to answer the question under the fifth
amendment because I do not consider this an opportunity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. You say you served in the Armed Forces for a
period of how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. Approximately 6 or 7 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. And why were you discharged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. That was because I was over 40.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. What was the extent of your services in the Armed
Forces? Were you in combat service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Westman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Are there any further questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Mr. Velde?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. No questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The witness is excused.</p>

<p>(Whereupon the witness was excused.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Frank Kerr.</p>

<p>Will you come forward? Just have a seat, please.</p>

<p>(Mr. Frank Kerr came forward, accompanied by his counsel, Jay
G. Sykes.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, this witness has been subpenaed,
and a doctor’s certificate has been given which is wholly inadequate as
a medical certificate to show that this gentleman was not in condition
to appear here.</p>

<p>Counsel was advised to get a doctor and give us a certificate that we
thought would mean something.</p>

<p>There may have been some confusion about who was to have the
examination made, but, regardless of that, it is quite apparent, from
observation, that the man is not well, and I don’t feel satisfied in
interrogating him under these circumstances unless the witness himself
wants to be interrogated.</p>

<p>(Mr. Sykes conferred with Mr. Kerr.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sykes</span>. He would rather not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Under those circumstances I do not feel like insisting
on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you wish the subpena to be continued or remain in
full force and effect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. No, sir. Under the circumstances, I think Mr. Kerr
should be dismissed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The witness is excused.</p>

<p>(Whereupon the witness was excused.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. There are no further witnesses, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The hearing will remain in order.</p>

<p>As chairman of this subcommittee, and on behalf of the staff of
the committee, our able counsel, Mr. Tavenner, and our investigator,
Mr. Wheeler, and myself, we are all deeply grateful to the police department
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
and the highly qualified police officers who have served this
committee so faithfully and efficiently.</p>

<p>We are also deeply grateful and want to express our appreciation to
all city, county, and Federal officials who have cooperated with us in
every possible way.</p>

<p>As a member of the Committee on Un-American Activities, I want
to say that I have attended many hearings in many sections of the
United States, and I have never had the pleasure of enjoying more
genuine, warm hospitality than has been extended to us during the
hearings which have been held here in Seattle, Wash.</p>

<p>I am deeply grateful for the opportunity and the honor of having
been associated with so many fine people as I have found here in
Seattle. They have cooperated with us during the hearings.</p>

<p>We also wish to express our deep appreciation for the efficient service
rendered by the sheriff’s office, as well as all other public officials
who have cooperated with us during the hearings.</p>

<p>Mr. Velde?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I simply want to say this, Mr. Chairman: I appreciate
the courteous and fair manner in which you have conducted the hearings
here in Seattle.</p>

<p>I have a soft spot in my heart for the people in Seattle, and I concur
with you that we have been given more courteous treatment, or at
least as courteous treatment here in the city of Seattle and in the
Northwest area as we have been given in any other section of the
country. We really do appreciate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Thank you very much, Mr. Velde.</p>

<p>The committee will be adjourned.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, Saturday, March 19, 1955, at 5:35 p. m., the committee
was recessed subject to the call of the Chair.)</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
